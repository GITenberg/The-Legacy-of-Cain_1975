      CHAPTER I. THE GOVERNOR EXPLAINS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the request of a person who has claims on me that I must not disown, I
      consent to look back through a long interval of years and to describe
      events which took place within the walls of an English prison during the
      earlier period of my appointment as Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewing my task by the light which later experience casts on it, I think I
      shall act wisely by exercising some control over the freedom of my pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I propose to pass over in silence the name of the town in which is
      situated the prison once confided to my care. I shall observe a similar
      discretion in alluding to individuals&mdash;some dead, some living, at the
      present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being obliged to write of a woman who deservedly suffered the extreme
      penalty of the law, I think she will be sufficiently identified if I call
      her The Prisoner. Of the four persons present on the evening before her
      execution three may be distinguished one from the other by allusion to
      their vocations in life. I here introduce them as The Chaplain, The
      Minister, and The Doctor. The fourth was a young woman. She has no claim
      on my consideration; and, when she is mentioned, her name may appear. If
      these reserves excite suspicion, I declare beforehand that they influence
      in no way the sense of responsibility which commands an honest man to
      speak the truth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE MURDERESS ASKS QUESTIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first of the events which I must now relate was the conviction of The
      Prisoner for the murder of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had lived together in matrimony for little more than two years. The
      husband, a gentleman by birth and education, had mortally offended his
      relations in marrying a woman of an inferior rank of life. He was fast
      declining into a state of poverty, through his own reckless extravagance,
      at the time when he met with his death at his wife&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without attempting to excuse him, he deserved, to my mind, some tribute of
      regret. It is not to be denied that he was profligate in his habits and
      violent in his temper. But it is equally true that he was affectionate in
      the domestic circle, and, when moved by wisely applied remonstrance,
      sincerely penitent for sins committed under temptation that overpowered
      him. If his wife had killed him in a fit of jealous rage&mdash;under
      provocation, be it remembered, which the witnesses proved&mdash;she might
      have been convicted of manslaughter, and might have received a light
      sentence. But the evidence so undeniably revealed deliberate and merciless
      premeditation, that the only defense attempted by her counsel was madness,
      and the only alternative left to a righteous jury was a verdict which
      condemned the woman to death. Those mischievous members of the community,
      whose topsy-turvy sympathies feel for the living criminal and forget the
      dead victim, attempted to save her by means of high-flown petitions and
      contemptible correspondence in the newspapers. But the Judge held firm;
      and the Home Secretary held firm. They were entirely right; and the public
      were scandalously wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Chaplain endeavored to offer the consolations of religion to the
      condemned wretch. She refused to accept his ministrations in language
      which filled him with grief and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening before the execution, the reverend gentleman laid on my
      table his own written report of a conversation which had passed between
      the Prisoner and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see some hope, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of inclining the heart of this woman to
      religious belief, before it is too late. Will you read my report, and say
      if you agree with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read it, of course. It was called &ldquo;A Memorandum,&rdquo; and was thus written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his last interview with the Prisoner, the Chaplain asked her if she
      had ever entered a place of public worship. She replied that she had
      occasionally attended the services at a Congregational Church in this
      town; attracted by the reputation of the Minister as a preacher. &lsquo;He
      entirely failed to make a Christian of me,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but I was struck by
      his eloquence. Besides, he interested me personally&mdash;he was a fine
      man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dreadful situation in which the woman was placed, such language as
      this shocked the Chaplain; he appealed in vain to the Prisoner&rsquo;s sense of
      propriety. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand women,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;The greatest saint
      of my sex that ever lived likes to look at a preacher as well as to hear
      him. If he is an agreeable man, he has all the greater effect on her. This
      preacher&rsquo;s voice told me he was kind-hearted; and I had only to look at
      his beautiful eyes to see that he was trustworthy and true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was useless to repeat a protest which had already failed. Recklessly
      and flippantly as she had described it, an impression had been produced on
      her. It occurred to the Chaplain that he might at least make the attempt
      to turn this result to her own religious advantage. He asked whether she
      would receive the Minister, if the reverend gentleman came to the prison.
      &lsquo;That will depend,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;on whether you answer some questions which
      I want to put to you first.&rsquo; The Chaplain consented; provided always that
      he could reply with propriety to what she asked of him. Her first question
      only related to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said: &lsquo;The women who watch me tell me that you are a widower, and
      have a family of children. Is that true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chaplain answered that it was quite true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She alluded next to a report, current in the town, that the Minister had
      resigned the pastorate. Being personally acquainted with him, the Chaplain
      was able to inform her that his resignation had not yet been accepted. On
      hearing this, she seemed to gather confidence. Her next inquiries
      succeeded each other rapidly, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is my handsome preacher married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Has he got any children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has never had any children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How long has he been married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As well as I know, about seven or eight years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What sort of woman is his wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A lady universally respected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether she is respected or not. Is she kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is her husband well off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has a sufficient income.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that reply, the Prisoner&rsquo;s curiosity appeared to be satisfied. She
      said, &lsquo;Bring your friend the preacher to me, if you like&rsquo;&mdash;and there
      it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What her object could have been in putting these questions, it seems to
      be impossible to guess. Having accurately reported all that took place,
      the Chaplain declares, with heartfelt regret, that he can exert no
      religious influence over this obdurate woman. He leaves it to the Governor
      to decide whether the Minister of the Congregational Church may not
      succeed, where the Chaplain of the Jail has failed. Herein is the one last
      hope of saving the soul of the Prisoner, now under sentence of death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those serious words the Memorandum ended. Although not personally
      acquainted with the Minister I had heard of him, on all sides, as an
      excellent man. In the emergency that confronted us he had, as it seemed to
      me, his own sacred right to enter the prison; assuming that he was willing
      to accept, what I myself felt to be, a very serious responsibility. The
      first necessity was to discover whether we might hope to obtain his
      services. With my full approval the Chaplain left me, to state the
      circumstances to his reverend colleague.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE CHILD APPEARS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During my friend&rsquo;s absence, my attention was claimed by a sad incident&mdash;not
      unforeseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, I suppose, generally known that near relatives are admitted to take
      their leave of criminals condemned to death. In the case of the Prisoner
      now waiting for execution, no person applied to the authorities for
      permission to see her. I myself inquired if she had any relations living,
      and if she would like to see them. She answered: &ldquo;None that I care to see,
      or that care to see me&mdash;except the nearest relation of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those last words the miserable creature alluded to her only child, a
      little girl (an infant, I should say), who had passed her first year&rsquo;s
      birthday by a few months. The farewell interview was to take place on the
      mother&rsquo;s last evening on earth; and the child was now brought into my
      rooms, in charge of her nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seldom seen a brighter or prettier little girl. She was just able to
      walk alone, and to enjoy the first delight of moving from one place to
      another. Quite of her own accord she came to me, attracted I daresay by
      the glitter of my watch-chain. Helping her to climb on my knee, I showed
      the wonders of the watch, and held it to her ear. At that past time, death
      had taken my good wife from me; my two boys were away at Harrow School; my
      domestic life was the life of a lonely man. Whether I was reminded of the
      bygone days when my sons were infants on my knee, listening to the ticking
      of my watch&mdash;or whether the friendless position of the poor little
      creature, who had lost one parent and was soon to lose the other by a
      violent death, moved me in depths of pity not easily reached in my later
      experience&mdash;I am not able to say. This only I know: my heart ached
      for the child while she was laughing and listening; and something fell
      from me on the watch which I don&rsquo;t deny might have been a tear. A few of
      the toys, mostly broken now, which my two children used to play with are
      still in my possession; kept, like my poor wife&rsquo;s favorite jewels, for old
      remembrance&rsquo; sake. These I took from their repository when the attraction
      of my watch showed signs of failing. The child pounced on them with her
      chubby hands, and screamed with pleasure. And the hangman was waiting for
      her mother&mdash;and, more horrid still, the mother deserved it!
    </p>
    <p>
      My duty required me to let the Prisoner know that her little daughter had
      arrived. Did that heart of iron melt at last? It might have been so, or it
      might not; the message sent back kept her secret. All that it said to me
      was: &ldquo;Let the child wait till I send for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister had consented to help us. On his arrival at the prison, I
      received him privately in my study.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only to look at his face&mdash;pitiably pale and agitated&mdash;to
      see that he was a sensitive man, not always able to control his nerves on
      occasions which tried his moral courage. A kind, I might almost say a
      noble face, and a voice unaffectedly persuasive, at once prepossessed me
      in his favor. The few words of welcome that I spoke were intended to
      compose him. They failed to produce the impression on which I had counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My experience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has included many melancholy duties, and has
      tried my composure in terrible scenes; but I have never yet found myself
      in the presence of an unrepentant criminal, sentenced to death&mdash;and
      that criminal a woman and a mother. I own, sir, that I am shaken by the
      prospect before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suggested that he should wait a while, in the hope that time and quiet
      might help him. He thanked me, and refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have any knowledge of myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;terrors of anticipation
      lose their hold when I am face to face with a serious call on me. The
      longer I remain here, the less worthy I shall appear of the trust that has
      been placed in me&mdash;the trust which, please God, I mean to deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My own observation of human nature told me that this was wisely said. I
      led the way at once to the cell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE MINISTER SAYS YES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Prisoner was seated on her bed, quietly talking with the woman
      appointed to watch her. When she rose to receive us, I saw the Minister
      start. The face that confronted him would, in my opinion, have taken any
      man by surprise, if he had first happened to see it within the walls of a
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors to the picture-galleries of Italy, growing weary of Holy Families
      in endless succession, observe that the idea of the Madonna, among the
      rank and file of Italian Painters, is limited to one changeless and
      familiar type. I can hardly hope to be believed when I say that the
      personal appearance of the murderess recalled that type. She presented the
      delicate light hair, the quiet eyes, the finely-shaped lower features and
      the correctly oval form of face, repeated in hundreds on hundreds of the
      conventional works of Art to which I have ventured to allude. To those who
      doubt me, I can only declare that what I have here written is undisguised
      and absolute truth. Let me add that daily observation of all classes of
      criminals, extending over many years, has considerably diminished my faith
      in physiognomy as a safe guide to the discovery of character. Nervous
      trepidation looks like guilt. Guilt, firmly sustained by insensibility,
      looks like innocence. One of the vilest wretches ever placed under my
      charge won the sympathies (while he was waiting for his trial) of every
      person who saw him, including even the persons employed in the prison.
      Only the other day, ladies and gentlemen coming to visit me passed a body
      of men at work on the road. Judges of physiognomy among them were
      horrified at the criminal atrocity betrayed in every face that they
      noticed. They condoled with me on the near neighborhood of so many
      convicts to my official place of residence. I looked out of the window and
      saw a group of honest laborers (whose only crime was poverty) employed by
      the parish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having instructed the female warder to leave the room&mdash;but to take
      care that she waited within call&mdash;I looked again at the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confronted by the serious responsibility that he had undertaken, he
      justified what he had said to me. Still pale, still distressed, he was now
      nevertheless master of himself. I turned to the door to leave him alone
      with the Prisoner. She called me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before this gentleman tries to convert me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you to wait
      here and be a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding that we were both willing to comply with this request, she
      addressed herself directly to the Minister. &ldquo;Suppose I promise to listen
      to your exhortations,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;what do you promise to do for me in
      return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice in which she spoke to him was steady and clear; a marked
      contrast to the tremulous earnestness with which he answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise to urge you to repentance and the confession of your crime. I
      promise to implore the divine blessing on me in the effort to save your
      poor guilty soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and listened to him, as if he was speaking to her in an
      unknown tongue, and went on with what she had to say as quietly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am hanged to-morrow, suppose I die without confessing, without
      repenting&mdash;are you one of those who believe I shall be doomed to
      eternal punishment in another life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in the mercy of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer my question, if you please. Is an impenitent sinner eternally
      punished? Do you believe that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Bible leaves me no other alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a while, evidently considering with special attention what
      she was about to say next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a religious man,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;would you be willing to make some
      sacrifice, rather than let a fellow-creature go&mdash;after a disgraceful
      death&mdash;to everlasting torment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no sacrifice in my power,&rdquo; he said, fervently, &ldquo;to which I
      would not rather submit than let you die in the present dreadful state of
      your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prisoner turned to me. &ldquo;Is the person who watches me waiting outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so kind as to call her in? I have a message for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that she had been leading the way to the delivery of that
      message, whatever it might be, in all that she had said up to the present
      time. So far my poor powers of penetration helped me, and no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warder appeared, and received her message. &ldquo;Tell the woman who has
      come here with my little girl that I want to see the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taken completely by surprise, I signed to the attendant to wait for
      further instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more I had sufficiently recovered myself to see the
      impropriety of permitting any obstacle to interpose between the Minister
      and his errand of mercy. I gently reminded the Prisoner that she would
      have a later opportunity of seeing her child. &ldquo;Your first duty,&rdquo; I told
      her, &ldquo;is to hear and to take to heart what the clergyman has to say to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time I attempted to leave the cell. For the second time
      this impenetrable woman called me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the parson away with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I refuse to listen to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient Minister yielded, and appealed to me to follow his example. I
      reluctantly sanctioned the delivery of the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief interval the child was brought to us, tired and sleepy. For
      a while the nurse roused her by setting her on her feet. She happened to
      notice the Minister first. Her bright eyes rested on him, gravely
      wondering. He kissed her, and, after a momentary hesitation, gave her to
      her mother. The horror of the situation overpowered him: he turned his
      face away from us. I understood what he felt; he almost overthrew my own
      self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prisoner spoke to the nurse in no friendly tone: &ldquo;You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse turned to me, ostentatiously ignoring the words that had been
      addressed to her. &ldquo;Am I to go, sir, or to stay?&rdquo; I suggested that she
      should return to the waiting-room. She returned at once in silence. The
      Prisoner looked after her as she went out, with such an expression of
      hatred in her eyes that the Minister noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that person done to offend you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the last person in the whole world whom I should have chosen to
      take care of my child, if the power of choosing had been mine. But I have
      been in prison, without a living creature to represent me or to take my
      part. No more of that; my troubles will be over in a few hours more. I
      want you to look at my little girl, whose troubles are all to come. Do you
      call her pretty? Do you feel interested in her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sorrow and pity in his face answered for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly sleeping, the poor baby rested on her mother&rsquo;s bosom. Was the
      heart of the murderess softened by the divine influence of maternal love?
      The hands that held the child trembled a little. For the first time it
      seemed to cost her an effort to compose herself, before she could speak to
      the Minister again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I die to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I leave my child helpless and
      friendless&mdash;disgraced by her mother&rsquo;s shameful death. The workhouse
      may take her&mdash;or a charitable asylum may take her.&rdquo; She paused; a
      first tinge of color rose on her pale face; she broke into an outburst of
      rage. &ldquo;Think of <i>my</i> daughter being brought up by charity! She may
      suffer poverty, she may be treated with contempt, she may be employed by
      brutal people in menial work. I can&rsquo;t endure it; it maddens me. If she is
      not saved from that wretched fate, I shall die despairing, I shall die
      cursing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister sternly stopped her before she could say the next word. To my
      astonishment she appeared to be humbled, to be even ashamed: she asked his
      pardon: &ldquo;Forgive me; I won&rsquo;t forget myself again. They tell me you have no
      children of your own. Is that a sorrow to you and your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her altered tone touched him. He answered sadly and kindly: &ldquo;It is the one
      sorrow of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The purpose which she had been keeping in view from the moment when the
      Minister entered her cell was no mystery now. Ought I to have interfered?
      Let me confess a weakness, unworthy perhaps of my office. I was so sorry
      for the child&mdash;I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      My silence encouraged the mother. She advanced to the Minister with the
      sleeping infant in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you have sometimes thought of adopting a child?&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Perhaps you can guess now what I had in my mind, when I asked if you
      would consent to a sacrifice? Will you take this wretched innocent little
      creature home with you?&rdquo; She lost her self-possession once more. &ldquo;A
      motherless creature to-morrow,&rdquo; she burst out. &ldquo;Think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God knows how I still shrunk from it! But there was no alternative now; I
      was bound to remember my duty to the excellent man, whose critical
      position at that moment was, in some degree at least, due to my hesitation
      in asserting my authority. Could I allow the Prisoner to presume on his
      compassionate nature, and to hurry him into a decision which, in his
      calmer moments, he might find reason to regret? I spoke to <i>him</i>.
      Does the man live who&mdash;having to say what I had to say&mdash;could
      have spoken to the doomed mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have allowed this to go on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In justice to
      yourself, sir, don&rsquo;t answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on me with a look of fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall answer,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw, or thought I saw, signs of yielding in his face. &ldquo;Take time,&rdquo; I
      persisted&mdash;&ldquo;take time to consider before you decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take time?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Are you inhuman enough to talk of time, in my
      presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid the sleeping child on her bed, and fell on her knees before the
      Minister: &ldquo;I promise to hear your exhortations&mdash;I promise to do all a
      woman can to believe and repent. Oh, I know myself! My heart, once
      hardened, is a heart that no human creature can touch. The one way to my
      better nature&mdash;if I have a better nature&mdash;is through that poor
      babe. Save her from the workhouse! Don&rsquo;t let them make a pauper of her!&rdquo;
       She sank prostrate at his feet, and beat her hands in frenzy on the floor.
      &ldquo;You want to save my guilty soul,&rdquo; she reminded him furiously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      but one way of doing it. Save my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised her. Her fierce tearless eyes questioned his face in a mute
      expectation dreadful to see. Suddenly, a foretaste of death&mdash;the
      death that was so near now!&mdash;struck her with a shivering fit: her
      head dropped on the Minister&rsquo;s shoulder. Other men might have shrunk from
      the contact of it. That true Christian let it rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the maddening sting of suspense, her sinking energies rallied for an
      instant. In a whisper, she was just able to put the supreme question to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? or No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint breath of relief, just audible in the silence, told me that she
      had heard him. It was her last effort. He laid her, insensible, on the
      bed, by the side of her sleeping child. &ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; was all he said to
      me; &ldquo;how could I refuse?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V. MISS CHANCE ASSERTS HERSELF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The services of our medical officer were required, in order to hasten the
      recovery of the Prisoner&rsquo;s senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Doctor and I left the cell together, she was composed, and ready
      (in the performance of her promise) to listen to the exhortations of the
      Minister. The sleeping child was left undisturbed, by the mother&rsquo;s desire.
      If the Minister felt tempted to regret what he had done, there was the
      artless influence which would check him! As we stepped into the corridor,
      I gave the female warder her instructions to remain on the watch, and to
      return to her post when she saw the Minister come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, my companion had walked on a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed of ability and experience within the limits of his profession,
      he was in other respects a man with a crotchety mind; bold to the verge of
      recklessness in the expression of his opinion; and possessed of a command
      of language that carried everything before it. Let me add that he was just
      and merciful in his intercourse with others, and I shall have summed him
      up fairly enough. When I joined him he seemed to be absorbed in
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of the Prisoner?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking of what is going on, at this moment, in the condemned cell,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;and wondering if any good will come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not without hope of a good result, and I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor disagreed with me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in that woman&rsquo;s penitence,&rdquo;
       he remarked; &ldquo;and I look upon the parson as a poor weak creature. What is
      to become of the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason for concealing from one of my colleagues the
      benevolent decision, on the part of the good Minister, of which I had been
      a witness. The Doctor listened to me with the first appearance of
      downright astonishment that I had ever observed in his face. When I had
      done, he made an extraordinary reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor, I retract what I said of the parson just now. He is one of the
      boldest men that ever stepped into a pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was the doctor in earnest? Strongly in earnest; there could be no doubt of
      it. Before I could ask him what he meant, he was called away to a patient
      on the other side of the prison. When we parted at the door of my room, I
      made it a request that my medical friend would return to me and explain
      what he had just said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering that you are the governor of a prison,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you are
      a singularly rash man. If I come back, how do you know I shall not bore
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My rashness runs the risk of that,&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something, before I allow you to run your risk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are
      you one of those people who think that the tempers of children are formed
      by the accidental influences which happen to be about them? Or do you
      agree with me that the tempers of children are inherited from their
      parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor (as I concluded) was still strongly impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s
      resolution to adopt a child whose wicked mother had committed the most
      atrocious of all crimes. Was some serious foreboding in secret possession
      of his mind? My curiosity to hear him was now increased tenfold. I replied
      without hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with his sense of humor twinkling in his eyes. &ldquo;Do you
      know I rather expected that answer?&rdquo; he said, slyly. &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left by myself, I took up the day&rsquo;s newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      My attention wandered; my thoughts were in the cell with the Minister and
      the Prisoner. How would it end? Sometimes, I was inclined to doubt with
      the Doctor. Sometimes, I took refuge in my own more hopeful view. These
      idle reflections were agreeably interrupted by the appearance of my
      friend, the Chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always welcome,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and doubly welcome just now. I am
      feeling a little worried and anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are naturally,&rdquo; the Chaplain added, &ldquo;not at all disposed to
      receive a stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the stranger a friend of yours?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Having occasion, just now, to go into the waiting-room, I found a
      young woman there, who asked me if she could see you. She thinks you have
      forgotten her, and she is tired of waiting. I merely undertook, of course,
      to mention what she had said to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse having been in this way recalled to my memory, I felt some
      little interest in seeing her, after what had passed in the cell. In
      plainer words, I was desirous of judging for myself whether she deserved
      the hostile feeling which the Prisoner had shown toward her. I thanked the
      Chaplain before he left me, and gave the servant the necessary
      instructions. When she entered the room, I looked at the woman attentively
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Youth and a fine complexion, a well-made figure and a natural grace of
      movement&mdash;these were her personal attractions, so far as I could see.
      Her defects were, to my mind, equally noticeable. Under a heavy forehead,
      her piercing eyes looked out at persons and things with an expression
      which was not to my taste. Her large mouth&mdash;another defect, in my
      opinion&mdash;would have been recommended to mercy, in the estimation of
      many men, by her magnificent teeth; white, well-shaped, cruelly regular.
      Believers in physiognomy might perhaps have seen the betrayal of an
      obstinate nature in the lengthy firmness of her chin. While I am trying to
      describe her, let me not forget her dress. A woman&rsquo;s dress is the mirror
      in which we may see the reflection of a woman&rsquo;s nature. Bearing in mind
      the melancholy and impressive circumstances under which she had brought
      the child to the prison, the gayety of color in her gown and her bonnet
      implied either a total want of feeling, or a total want of tact. As to her
      position in life, let me confess that I felt, after a closer examination,
      at a loss to determine it. She was certainly not a lady. The Prisoner had
      spoken of her as if she was a domestic servant who had forfeited her right
      to consideration and respect. And she had entered the prison, as a nurse
      might have entered it, in charge of a child. I did what we all do when we
      are not clever enough to find the answer to a riddle&mdash;I gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;how much longer I am to be kept
      waiting in this prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The decision,&rdquo; I reminded her, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t depend on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who does it depend on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister had undoubtedly acquired the sole right of deciding. It was
      for him to say whether this woman should, or should not, remain in
      attendance on the child whom he had adopted. In the meanwhile, the feeling
      of distrust which was gaining on my mind warned me to remember the value
      of reserve in holding intercourse with a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be irritated by my silence. &ldquo;If the decision doesn&rsquo;t rest
      with you,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;why did you tell me to stay in the waiting-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brought the little girl into the prison,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;was it not natural
      to suppose that your mistress might want you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had evidently given offense; I stopped directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No person on the face of the earth,&rdquo; she declared, loftily, &ldquo;has ever had
      the right to call herself my mistress. Of my own free will, sir, I took
      charge of the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are fond of her?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was unwise on my part&mdash;I protested. &ldquo;Hate a baby little more than
      a year old!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Her</i> baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said it with the air of a woman who had produced an unanswerable
      reason. &ldquo;I am accountable to nobody,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;If I consented to
      trouble myself with the child, it was in remembrance of my friendship&mdash;notice,
      if you please, that I say friendship&mdash;with the unhappy father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Putting together what I had just heard, and what I had seen in the cell, I
      drew the right conclusion at last. The woman, whose position in life had
      been thus far an impenetrable mystery to me, now stood revealed as one,
      among other objects of the Prisoner&rsquo;s jealousy, during her disastrous
      married life. A serious doubt occurred to me as to the authority under
      which the husband&rsquo;s mistress might be acting, after the husband&rsquo;s death. I
      instantly put it to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand you to assert any claim to the child?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claim?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I know no more of the child than you do. I heard
      for the first time that such a creature was in existence, when her
      murdered father sent for me in his dying moments. At his entreaty I
      promised to take care of her, while her vile mother was out of the house
      and in the hands of the law. My promise has been performed. If I am
      expected (having brought her to the prison) to take her away again,
      understand this: I am under no obligation (even if I could afford it) to
      burden myself with that child; I shall hand her over to the workhouse
      authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I forgot myself once more&mdash;I lost my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Your unworthy hands will not touch the poor
      baby again. She is provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo; the wretch burst out. &ldquo;Who has taken the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quiet voice answered: &ldquo;<i>I</i> have taken her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both looked round and saw the Minister standing in the open doorway,
      with the child in his arms. The ordeal that he had gone through in the
      condemned cell was visible in his face; he looked miserably haggard and
      broken. I was eager to know if his merciful interest in the Prisoner had
      purified her guilty soul&mdash;but at the same time I was afraid, after
      what he had but too plainly suffered, to ask him to enter into details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one word,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Are your anxieties at rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s mercy has helped me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have not spoken in vain. She
      believes; she repents; she has confessed the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After handing the written and signed confession to me, he approached the
      venomous creature, still lingering in the room to hear what passed between
      us. Before I could stop him, he spoke to her, under a natural impression
      that he was addressing the Prisoner&rsquo;s servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will be disappointed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I tell you that
      your services will no longer be required. I have reasons for placing the
      child under the care of a nurse of my own choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened with an evil smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who furnished you with your reasons,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Apologies are
      quite needless, so far as I am concerned. If you had proposed to me to
      look after the new member of your family there, I should have felt it my
      duty to myself to have refused. I am not a nurse&mdash;I am an independent
      single lady. I see by your dress that you are a clergyman. Allow me to
      present myself as a mark of respect to your cloth. I am Miss Elizabeth
      Chance. May I ask the favor of your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too weary and too preoccupied to notice the insolence of her manner, the
      Minister mentioned his name. &ldquo;I am anxious,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to know if the
      child has been baptized. Perhaps you can enlighten me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still insolent, Miss Elizabeth Chance shook her head carelessly. &ldquo;I never
      heard&mdash;and, to tell you the truth, I never cared to hear&mdash;whether
      she was christened or not. Call her by what name you like, I can tell you
      this&mdash;you will find your adopted daughter a heavy handful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister turned to me. &ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to tell you,&rdquo; Miss Chance interposed. &ldquo;Being a clergyman, you
      know who Deborah was? Very well. I am Deborah now; and <i>I</i> prophesy.&rdquo;
       She pointed to the child. &ldquo;Remember what I say, reverend sir! You will
      find the tigress-cub take after its mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those parting words, she favored us with a low curtsey, and left the
      room.

      CHAPTER VI. THE DOCTOR DOUBTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Minister looked at me in an absent manner; his attention seemed to
      have been wandering. &ldquo;What was it Miss Chance said?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could speak, a friend&rsquo;s voice at the door interrupted us. The
      Doctor, returning to me as he had promised, answered the Minister&rsquo;s
      question in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have passed the person you mean, sir, as I was coming in here; and
      I heard her say: &lsquo;You will find the tigress-cub take after its mother.&rsquo; If
      she had known how to put her meaning into good English, Miss Chance&mdash;that
      is the name you mentioned, I think&mdash;might have told you that the
      vices of the parents are inherited by the children. And the one particular
      parent she had in her mind,&rdquo; the Doctor continued, gently patting the
      child&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;was no doubt the mother of this unfortunate little
      creature&mdash;who may, or may not, live to show you that she comes of a
      bad stock and inherits a wicked nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was on the point of protesting against my friend&rsquo;s interpretation, when
      the Minister stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me thank you, sir, for your explanation,&rdquo; he said to the Doctor. &ldquo;As
      soon as my mind is free, I will reflect on what you have said. Forgive me,
      Mr. Governor,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if I leave you, now that I have placed the
      Prisoner&rsquo;s confession in your hands. It has been an effort to me to say
      the little I have said, since I first entered this room. I can think of
      nothing but that unhappy criminal, and the death that she must die
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she wish you to be present?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She positively forbids it. &lsquo;After what you have done for me,&rsquo; she said,
      &lsquo;the least I can do in return is to prevent your being needlessly
      distressed.&rsquo; She took leave of me; she kissed the little girl for the last
      time&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t ask me to tell you about it! I shall break down if I
      try. Come, my darling!&rdquo; He kissed the child tenderly, and took her away
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man is a strange compound of strength and weakness,&rdquo; the Doctor
      remarked. &ldquo;Did you notice his face, just now? Nine men out of ten,
      suffering as he suffered, would have failed to control themselves. Such
      resolution as his <i>may</i> conquer the difficulties that are in store
      for him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a trial of my temper to hear my clever colleague justifying, in
      this way, the ignorant prediction of an insolent woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are exceptions to all rules,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;And why are the virtues
      of the parents not just as likely to descend to the children as the vices?
      There was a fund of good, I can tell you, in that poor baby&rsquo;s father&mdash;though
      I don&rsquo;t deny that he was a profligate man. And even the horrible mother&mdash;as
      you heard just now&mdash;has virtue enough left in her to feel grateful to
      the man who has taken care of her child. These are facts; you can&rsquo;t
      dispute them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor took out his pipe. &ldquo;Do you mind my smoking?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tobacco
      helps me to arrange my ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the means of arranging his ideas; that is to say, I gave him
      the match-box. He blew some preliminary clouds of smoke and then he
      answered me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For twenty years past, my friend, I have been studying the question of
      hereditary transmission of qualities; and I have found vices and diseases
      descending more frequently to children than virtue and health. I don&rsquo;t
      stop to ask why: there is no end to that sort of curiosity. What I have
      observed is what I tell you; no more and no less. You will say this is a
      horribly discouraging result of experience, for it tends to show that
      children come into the world at a disadvantage on the day of their birth.
      Of course they do. Children are born deformed; children are born deaf,
      dumb, or blind; children are born with the seeds in them of deadly
      diseases. Who can account for the cruelties of creation? Why are we
      endowed with life&mdash;only to end in death? And does it ever strike you,
      when you are cutting your mutton at dinner, and your cat is catching its
      mouse, and your spider is suffocating its fly, that we are all, big and
      little together, born to one certain inheritance&mdash;the privilege of
      eating each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;But it will all be set right in another world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure of that?&rdquo; the Doctor asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure, thank God! And it would be better for you if you felt about
      it as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t dispute, my dear Governor. I don&rsquo;t scoff at comforting hopes; I
      don&rsquo;t deny the existence of occasional compensations. But I do see,
      nevertheless, that Evil has got the upper hand among us, on this curious
      little planet. Judging by my observation and experience, that ill-fated
      baby&rsquo;s chance of inheriting the virtues of her parents is not to be
      compared with her chances of inheriting their vices; especially if she
      happens to take after her mother. <i>There</i> the virtue is not
      conspicuous, and the vice is one enormous fact. When I think of the growth
      of that poisonous hereditary taint, which may come with time&mdash;when I
      think of passions let loose and temptations lying in ambush&mdash;I see
      the smooth surface of the Minister&rsquo;s domestic life with dangers lurking
      under it which make me shake in my shoes. God! what a life I should lead,
      if I happened to be in his place, some years hence. Suppose I said or did
      something (in the just exercise of my parental authority) which offended
      my adopted daughter. What figure would rise from the dead in my memory,
      when the girl bounced out of the room in a rage? The image of her mother
      would be the image I should see. I should remember what her mother did
      when <i>she</i> was provoked; I should lock my bedroom door, in my own
      house, at night. I should come down to breakfast with suspicions in my cup
      of tea, if I discovered that my adopted daughter had poured it out. Oh,
      yes; it&rsquo;s quite true that I might be doing the girl a cruel injustice all
      the time; but how am I to be sure of that? I am only sure that her mother
      was hanged for one of the most merciless murders committed in our time.
      Pass the match-box. My pipe&rsquo;s out, and my confession of faith has come to
      an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to dispute with a man who possessed his command of
      language. At the same time, there was a bright side to the poor Minister&rsquo;s
      prospects which the Doctor had failed to see. It was barely possible that
      I might succeed in putting my positive friend in the wrong. I tried the
      experiment, at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have forgotten,&rdquo; I reminded him, &ldquo;that the child will have
      every advantage that education can offer to her, and will be accustomed
      from her earliest years to restraining and purifying influences, in a
      clergyman&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that he was enjoying the fumes of tobacco, the Doctor was as placid
      and sweet-tempered as a man could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you doubt the influence of religion?&rdquo; I asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, sweetly: &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the influence of kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the force of example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t deny it for the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not expected this extraordinary docility. The Doctor had got the
      upper hand of me again&mdash;a state of things that I might have found it
      hard to endure, but for a call of duty which put an end to our sitting.
      One of the female warders appeared with a message from the condemned cell.
      The Prisoner wished to see the Governor and the Medical Officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo; the Doctor inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hysterical? or agitated, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As easy and composed, sir, as a person can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We set forth together for the condemned cell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE MURDERESS CONSULTS THE AUTHORITIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a considerate side to my friend&rsquo;s character, which showed itself
      when the warder had left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was especially anxious to be careful of what he said to a woman in the
      Prisoner&rsquo;s terrible situation; especially in the event of her having been
      really subjected to the influence of religious belief. On the Minister&rsquo;s
      own authority, I declared that there was every reason to adopt this
      conclusion; and in support of what I had said I showed him the confession.
      It only contained a few lines, acknowledging that she had committed the
      murder and that she deserved her sentence. &ldquo;From the planning of the crime
      to the commission of the crime, I was in my right senses throughout. I
      knew what I was doing.&rdquo; With that remarkable disavowal of the defense set
      up by her advocate, the confession ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      My colleague read the paper, and handed it back to me without making any
      remark. I asked if he suspected the Prisoner of feigning conversion to
      please the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall not discover it,&rdquo; he answered, gravely, &ldquo;if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would not be true to say that the Doctor&rsquo;s obstinacy had shaken my
      belief in the good result of the Minister&rsquo;s interference. I may, however,
      acknowledge that I felt some misgivings, which were not dispelled when I
      found myself in the presence of the Prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had expected to see her employed in reading the Bible. The good book was
      closed and was not even placed within her reach. The occupation to which
      she was devoting herself astonished and repelled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some carelessness on the part of the attendant had left on the table the
      writing materials that had been needed for her confession. She was using
      them now&mdash;when death on the scaffold was literally within a few hours
      of her&mdash;to sketch a portrait of the female warder, who was on the
      watch! The Doctor and I looked at each other; and now the sincerity of her
      repentance was something that I began to question, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid down the pen, and proceeded quietly to explain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the little time that is left to me proves to be a weary time to get
      through,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am making a last use of the talent for drawing and
      catching a likeness, which has been one of my gifts since I was a girl.
      You look as if you didn&rsquo;t approve of such employment as this for a woman
      who is going to be hanged. Well, sir, I have no doubt you are right.&rdquo; She
      paused, and tore up the portrait. &ldquo;If I have misbehaved myself,&rdquo; she
      resumed, &ldquo;I make amends. To find you in an indulgent frame of mind is of
      importance to me just now. I have a favor to ask of you. May the warder
      leave the cell for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving the woman permission to withdraw for a while, I waited with some
      anxiety to hear what the Prisoner wanted of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;on the subject of
      executions. The face of a person who is going to be hanged is hidden, as I
      have been told, by a white cap drawn over it. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How another man might have felt, in my place, I cannot, of course, say. To
      my mind, such a question&mdash;on <i>her</i> lips&mdash;was too shocking
      to be answered in words. I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the body is buried,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;in the prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could remain silent no longer. &ldquo;Is there no human feeling left in you?&rdquo;
       I burst out. &ldquo;What do these horrid questions mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, sir; you shall hear directly. I want to know
      first if I am to be buried in the prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied as before, by a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I may tell you what I mean. In the autumn of last year I
      was taken to see some waxworks. Portraits of criminals were among them.
      There was one portrait&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated; her infernal self-possession
      failed her at last. The color left her face; she was no longer able to
      look at me firmly. &ldquo;There was one portrait,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that had been
      taken after the execution. The face was so hideous; it was swollen to such
      a size in its frightful deformity&mdash;oh, sir, don&rsquo;t let me be seen in
      that state, even by the strangers who bury me! Use your influence&mdash;forbid
      them to take the cap off my face when I am dead&mdash;order them to bury
      me in it, and I swear to you I&rsquo;ll meet death tomorrow as coolly as the
      boldest man that ever mounted the scaffold!&rdquo; Before I could stop her, she
      seized me by the hand, and wrung it with a furious power that left the
      mark of her grasp on me, in a bruise, for days afterward. &ldquo;Will you do
      it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an honorable man; you will keep your word. Give me
      your promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her my promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relief to her tortured spirit expressed itself horribly in a burst of
      frantic laughter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My enemies said of me, when I got my appointment, that I was too excitable
      a man to be governor of a prison. Perhaps they were not altogether wrong.
      Anyhow, the quick-witted Doctor saw some change in me, which I was not
      aware of myself. He took my arm and led me out of the cell. &ldquo;Leave her to
      me,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The fine edge of my nerves was worn off long ago in
      the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we met again, I asked what had passed between the Prisoner and
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave her time to recover,&rdquo; he told me; &ldquo;and, except that she looked a
      little paler than usual, there was no trace left of the frenzy that you
      remember. &lsquo;I ought to apologize for troubling you,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but it is
      perhaps natural that I should think, now and then, of what is to happen to
      me to-morrow morning. As a medical man, you will be able to enlighten me.
      Is death by hanging a painful death?&rsquo; She had put it so politely that I
      felt bound to answer her. &lsquo;If the neck happens to be broken,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;hanging is a sudden death; fright and pain (if there is any pain) are
      both over in an instant. As to the other form of death which is also
      possible (I mean death by suffocation), I must own as an honest man that I
      know no more about it than you do.&rsquo; After considering a little, she made a
      sensible remark, and followed it by an embarrassing request. &lsquo;A great
      deal,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;must depend on the executioner. I am not afraid of
      death, Doctor. Why should I be? My anxiety about my little girl is set at
      rest; I have nothing left to live for. But I don&rsquo;t like pain. Would you
      mind telling the executioner to be careful? Or would it be better if I
      spoke to him myself?&rsquo; I said I thought it would come with a better grace
      from herself. She understood me directly; and we dropped the subject. Are
      you surprised at her coolness, after your experience of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confessed that I was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think a little,&rdquo; the Doctor said. &ldquo;The one sensitive place in that
      woman&rsquo;s nature is the place occupied by her self-esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I objected to this that she had shown fondness for her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend disposed of the objection with his customary readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maternal instinct,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A cat is fond of her kittens; a cow is
      fond of her calf. No, sir, the one cause of that outbreak of passion which
      so shocked you&mdash;a genuine outbreak, beyond all doubt&mdash;is to be
      found in the vanity of a fine feminine creature, overpowered by a horror
      of looking hideous, even after her death. Do you know I rather like that
      woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that you are in earnest?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know as well as you do,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that this is neither a time nor
      a place for jesting. The fact is, the Prisoner carries out an idea of
      mine. It is my positive conviction that the worst murders&mdash;I mean
      murders deliberately planned&mdash;are committed by persons absolutely
      deficient in that part of the moral organization which <i>feels</i>. The
      night before they are hanged they sleep. On their last morning they eat a
      breakfast. Incapable of realizing the horror of murder, they are incapable
      of realizing the horror of death. Do you remember the last murderer who
      was hanged here&mdash;a gentleman&rsquo;s coachman who killed his wife? He had
      but two anxieties while he was waiting for execution. One was to get his
      allowance of beer doubled, and the other was to be hanged in his
      coachman&rsquo;s livery. No! no! these wretches are all alike; they are human
      creatures born with the temperaments of tigers. Take my word for it, we
      need feel no anxiety about to-morrow. The Prisoner will face the crowd
      round the scaffold with composure; and the people will say, &lsquo;She died
      game.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE MINISTER SAYS GOOD-BY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Capital Punishment of the Prisoner is in no respect connected with my
      purpose in writing the present narrative. Neither do I desire to darken
      these pages by describing in detail an act of righteous retribution which
      must present, by the nature of it, a scene of horror. For these reasons I
      ask to be excused, if I limit what I must needs say of the execution
      within the compass of a few words&mdash;and pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one self-possessed person among us was the miserable woman who
      suffered the penalty of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very discreetly, as I think, the Chaplain asked her if she had truly
      repented. She answered: &ldquo;I have confessed the crime, sir. What more do you
      want?&rdquo; To my mind&mdash;still hesitating between the view that believes
      with the Minister, and the view that doubts with the Doctor&mdash;this
      reply leaves a way open to hope of her salvation. Her last words to me, as
      she mounted the steps of the scaffold, were: &ldquo;Remember your promise.&rdquo; It
      was easy for me to be true to my word. At that bygone time, no
      difficulties were placed in my way by such precautions as are now observed
      in the conduct of executions within the walls of the prison. From the time
      of her death to the time of her burial, no living creature saw her face.
      She rests, veiled in her prison grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me now turn to living interests, and to scenes removed from the
      thunder-clouds of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day I received a visit from the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first words entreated me not to allude to the terrible event of the
      previous day. &ldquo;I cannot escape thinking of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I may avoid
      speaking of it.&rdquo; This seemed to me to be the misplaced confidence of a
      weak man in the refuge of silence. By way of changing the subject, I spoke
      of the child. There would be serious difficulties to contend with (as I
      ventured to suggest), if he remained in the town, and allowed his new
      responsibilities to become the subject of public talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply to this agreeably surprised me. There were no difficulties to be
      feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of his wife&rsquo;s health had obliged him (acting under medical
      advice) to try the influence of her native air. An interval of some months
      might elapse before the good effect of the change had sufficiently
      declared itself; and a return to the peculiar climate of the town might
      bring on a relapse. There had consequently been no alternative to but
      resign his charge. Only on that day the resignation had been accepted&mdash;with
      expressions of regret sincerely reciprocated by himself. He proposed to
      leave the town immediately; and one of the objects of his visit was to bid
      me good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next place I live in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be more than a hundred miles
      away. At that distance I may hope to keep events concealed which must be
      known only to ourselves. So far as I can see, there are no risks of
      discovery lurking in this place. My servants (only two in number) have
      both been born here, and have both told my wife that they have no wish to
      go away. As to the person who introduced herself to me by the name of Miss
      Chance, she was traced to the railway station yesterday afternoon, and
      took her ticket for London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I congratulated the Minister on the good fortune which had befriended him,
      so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand how carefully I have provided against being
      deceived,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when I tell you what my plans are. The persons
      among whom my future lot is cast&mdash;and the child herself, of course&mdash;must
      never suspect that the new member of my family is other than my own
      daughter. This is deceit, I admit; but it is deceit that injures no one. I
      hope you see the necessity for it, as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt of the necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the child was described as adopted, there would be curiosity about the
      circumstances, and inquiries relating to the parents. Prevaricating
      replies lead to suspicion, and suspicion to discovery. But for the wise
      course which the Minister had decided on taking, the poor child&rsquo;s life
      might have been darkened by the horror of the mother&rsquo;s crime, and the
      infamy of the mother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having quieted my friend&rsquo;s needless scruples by this perfectly sincere
      expression of opinion, I ventured to approach the central figure in his
      domestic circle, by means of a question relating to his wife. How had that
      lady received the unfortunate little creature, for whose appearance on the
      home-scene she must have been entirely unprepared?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister&rsquo;s manner showed some embarrassment; he prefaced what he had
      to tell me with praises of his wife, equally creditable no doubt to both
      of them. The beauty of the child, the pretty ways of the child, he said,
      fascinated the admirable woman at first sight. It was not to be denied
      that she had felt, and had expressed, misgivings, on being informed of the
      circumstances under which the Minister&rsquo;s act of mercy had been performed.
      But her mind was too well balanced to incline to this state of feeling,
      when her husband had addressed her in defense of his conduct. She then
      understood that the true merit of a good action consisted in patiently
      facing the sacrifices involved. Her interest in the new daughter being, in
      this way, ennobled by a sense of Christian duty, there had been no further
      difference of opinion between the married pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to this plausible explanation with interest, but, at the same
      time, with doubts of the lasting nature of the lady&rsquo;s submission to
      circumstances; suggested, perhaps, by the constraint in the Minister&rsquo;s
      manner. It was well for both of us when we changed the subject. He
      reminded me of the discouraging view which the Doctor had taken of the
      prospect before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not attempt to decide whether your friend is right or wrong,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Trusting, as I do, in the mercy of God, I look hopefully to a
      future time when all that is brightest and best in the nature of my
      adopted child will be developed under my fostering care. If evil
      tendencies show themselves, my reliance will be confidently placed on
      pious example, on religious instruction, and, above all, on intercession
      by prayer. Repeat to your friend,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;what you have just heard
      me say. Let him ask himself if he could confront the uncertain future with
      my cheerful submission and my steadfast hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He intrusted me with that message, and gave me his hand. So we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with him, I admired him; but my faith seemed to want sustaining
      power, as compared with his faith. On his own showing (as it appeared to
      me), there would be two forces in a state of conflict in the child&rsquo;s
      nature as she grew up&mdash;inherited evil against inculcated good. Try as
      I might, I failed to feel the Minister&rsquo;s comforting conviction as to which
      of the two would win.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE GOVERNOR RECEIVES A VISIT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after the good man had left us, I met with a serious accident,
      caused by a false step on the stone stairs of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long illness which followed this misfortune, and my removal afterward
      (in the interests of my recovery) to a milder climate than the climate of
      England, obliged me to confide the duties of governor of the prison to a
      representative. I was absent from my post for rather more than a year.
      During this interval no news reached me from my reverend friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having returned to the duties of my office, I thought of writing to the
      Minister. While the proposed letter was still in contemplation, I was
      informed that a lady wished to see me. She sent in her card. My visitor
      proved to be the Minister&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed her with no ordinary attention when she entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress was simple; her scanty light hair, so far as I could see it
      under her bonnet, was dressed with taste. The paleness of her lips, and
      the faded color in her face, suggested that she was certainly not in good
      health. Two peculiarities struck me in her personal appearance. I never
      remembered having seen any other person with such a singularly narrow and
      slanting forehead as this lady presented; and I was impressed, not at all
      agreeably, by the flashing shifting expression in her eyes. On the other
      hand, let me own that I was powerfully attracted and interested by the
      beauty of her voice. Its fine variety of compass, and its musical
      resonance of tone, fell with such enchantment on the ear, that I should
      have liked to put a book of poetry into her hand, and to have heard her
      read it in summer-time, accompanied by the music of a rocky stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of her visit&mdash;so far as she explained it at the outset&mdash;appeared
      to be to offer her congratulations on my recovery, and to tell me that her
      husband had assumed the charge of a church in a large town not far from
      her birthplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even those commonplace words were made interesting by her delicious voice.
      But however sensitive to sweet sounds a man may be, there are limits to
      his capacity for deceiving himself&mdash;especially when he happens to be
      enlightened by experience of humanity within the walls of a prison. I had,
      it may be remembered, already doubted the lady&rsquo;s good temper, judging from
      her husband&rsquo;s over-wrought description of her virtues. Her eyes looked at
      me furtively; and her manner, gracefully self-possessed as it was,
      suggested that she had something of a delicate, or disagreeable, nature to
      say to me, and that she was at a loss how to approach the subject so as to
      produce the right impression on my mind at the outset. There was a
      momentary silence between us. For the sake of saying something, I asked
      how she and the Minister liked their new place of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our new place of residence,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;has been made interesting by
      a very unexpected event&mdash;an event (how shall I describe it?) which
      has increased our happiness and enlarged our family circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she stopped: expecting me, as I fancied, to guess what she meant. A
      woman, and that woman a mother, might have fulfilled her anticipations. A
      man, and that man not listening attentively, was simply puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse my stupidity,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s temper looked at me out of the lady&rsquo;s shifting eyes, and hid
      itself again in a moment. She set herself right in my estimation by taking
      the whole blame of our little misunderstanding on her own innocent
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have spoken more plainly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me try what I can do
      now. After many years of disappointment in my married life, it has pleased
      Providence to bestow on me the happiness&mdash;the inexpressible happiness&mdash;of
      being a mother. My baby is a sweet little girl; and my one regret is that
      I cannot nurse her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My languid interest in the Minister&rsquo;s wife was not stimulated by the
      announcement of this domestic event.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt no wish to see the &ldquo;sweet little girl&rdquo;; I was not even reminded of
      another example of long-deferred maternity, which had occurred within the
      limits of my own family circle. All my sympathies attached themselves to
      the sad little figure of the adopted child. I remembered the poor baby on
      my knee, enchanted by the ticking of my watch&mdash;I thought of her,
      peacefully and prettily asleep under the horrid shelter of the condemned
      cell&mdash;and it is hardly too much to say that my heart was heavy, when
      I compared her prospects with the prospects of her baby-rival. Kind as he
      was, conscientious as he was, could the Minister be expected to admit to
      an equal share in his love the child endeared to him as a father, and the
      child who merely reminded him of an act of mercy? As for his wife, it
      seemed the merest waste of time to put her state of feeling (placed
      between the two children) to the test of inquiry. I tried the useless
      experiment, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pleasant to think,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;that your other daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted me, with the utmost gentleness: &ldquo;Do you mean the child
      that my husband was foolish enough to adopt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather fortunate enough to adopt,&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;As your own little
      girl grows up, she will want a playfellow. And she will find a playfellow
      in that other child, whom the good Minister has taken for his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear sir&mdash;not if I can prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between the cruelty of her intention, and the musical beauty
      of the voice which politely expressed it in those words, really startled
      me. I was at a loss how to answer her, at the very time when I ought to
      have been most ready to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must surely understand,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t want another
      person&rsquo;s child, now we have a little darling of our own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your husband agree with you in that view?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no! He said what you said just now, and (oddly enough) almost in
      the same words. But I don&rsquo;t at all despair of persuading him to change his
      mind&mdash;and you can help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made that audacious assertion with such an appearance of feeling
      perfectly sure of me, that my politeness gave way under the strain laid on
      it. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the least impressed by my change of manner, she took from the
      pocket of her dress a printed paper. &ldquo;You will find what I mean there,&rdquo;
       she replied&mdash;and put the paper into my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an appeal to the charitable public, occasioned by the enlargement
      of an orphan-asylum, with which I had been connected for many years. What
      she meant was plain enough now. I said nothing: I only looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleased to find that I was clever enough to guess what she meant, on this
      occasion, the Minister&rsquo;s wife informed me that the circumstances were all
      in our favor. She still persisted in taking me into partnership&mdash;the
      circumstances were in <i>our</i> favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two years more,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;the child of that detestable creature
      who was hanged&mdash;do you know, I cannot even look at the little wretch
      without thinking of the gallows?&mdash;will be old enough (with your
      interest to help us) to be received into the asylum. What a relief it will
      be to get rid of that child! And how hard I shall work at canvassing for
      subscribers&rsquo; votes! Your name will be a tower of strength when I use it as
      a reference. Pardon me&mdash;you are not looking so pleasantly as usual.
      Do you see some obstacles in our way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see two obstacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can they possibly be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time, my politeness gave way under the strain laid on it.
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what one of the obstacles is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that you contemplate any serious resistance on the
      part of my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unaffectedly amused by my simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a single man?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a widower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your experience ought to tell you that I know every weak point in
      the Minister&rsquo;s character. I can tell him, on your authority, that the
      hateful child will be placed in competent and kindly hands&mdash;and I
      have my own sweet baby to plead for me. With these advantages in my favor,
      do you actually suppose I can fail to make <i>my</i> way of thinking <i>his</i>
      way of thinking? You must have forgotten your own married life! Suppose we
      go on to the second of your two obstacles. I hope it will be better worth
      considering than the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second obstacle will not disappoint you,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I am the
      obstacle, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps reflection may alter your resolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflection will do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rude, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In speaking to you, madam, I have no alternative but to speak plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose. Her shifting eyes, for once, looked at me steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of enemy have I made of you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;A passive enemy who
      is content with refusing to help me? Or an active enemy who will write to
      my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends entirely,&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;on what your husband does. If he
      questions me about you, I shall tell him the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I shall hope to forget that you ever favored me with a
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In making this reply I was guiltless of any malicious intention. What evil
      interpretation she placed on my words it is impossible for me to say; I
      can only declare that some intolerable sense of injury hurried her into an
      outbreak of rage. Her voice, strained for the first time, lost its tuneful
      beauty of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see us in two years&rsquo; time,&rdquo; she burst out&mdash;&ldquo;and discover
      the orphan of the gallows in our house if you can! If your Asylum won&rsquo;t
      take her, some other Charity will. Ha, Mr. Governor, I deserve my
      disappointment! I ought to have remembered that you are only a jailer
      after all. And what is a jailer? Proverbially a brute. Do you hear that? A
      brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her strength suddenly failed her. She dropped back into the chair from
      which she had risen, with a faint cry of pain. A ghastly pallor stole over
      her face. There was wine on the sideboard; I filled a glass. She refused
      to take it. At that time in the day, the Doctor&rsquo;s duties required his
      attendance in the prison. I instantly sent for him. After a moment&rsquo;s look
      at her, he took the wine out of my hand, and held the glass to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; he said. She still refused. &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; he reiterated, &ldquo;or you
      will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That frightened her; she drank the wine. The Doctor waited for a while
      with his fingers on her pulse. &ldquo;She will do now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go wherever you please, madam&mdash;so long as you don&rsquo;t go upstairs in a
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled: &ldquo;I understand you, sir&mdash;and thank you for your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked the Doctor, when we were alone, what made him tell her not to go
      upstairs in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I felt,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;when I had my fingers on her pulse. You heard
      her say that she understood me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t know what she meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She meant, probably, that her own doctor had warned her as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something seriously wrong with her health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. MISS CHANCE REAPPEARS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week had passed, since the Minister&rsquo;s wife had left me, when I received
      a letter from the Minister himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After surprising me, as he innocently supposed, by announcing the birth of
      his child, he mentioned some circumstances connected with that event,
      which I now heard for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within an easy journey of the populous scene of my present labors,&rdquo; he
      wrote, &ldquo;there is a secluded country village called Low Lanes. The rector
      of the place is my wife&rsquo;s brother. Before the birth of our infant, he had
      asked his sister to stay for a while at his house; and the doctor thought
      she might safely be allowed to accept the invitation. Through some error
      in the customary calculations, as I suppose, the child was born
      unexpectedly at the rectory; and the ceremony of baptism was performed at
      the church, under circumstances which I am not able to relate within the
      limits of a letter: Let me only say that I allude to this incident without
      any sectarian bitterness of feeling&mdash;for I am no enemy to the Church
      of England. You have no idea what treasures of virtue and treasures of
      beauty maternity has revealed in my wife&rsquo;s sweet nature. Other mothers, in
      her proud position, might find their love cooling toward the poor child
      whom we have adopted. But my household is irradiated by the presence of an
      angel, who gives an equal share in her affections to the two little ones
      alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this semi-hysterical style of writing, the poor man unconsciously told
      me how cunningly and how cruelly his wife was deceiving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I longed to exhibit that wicked woman in her true character&mdash;but what
      could I do? She must have been so favored by circumstances as to be able
      to account for her absence from home, without exciting the slightest
      suspicion of the journey which she had really taken, if I declared in my
      reply to the Minister&rsquo;s letter that I had received her in my rooms, and if
      I repeated the conversation that had taken place, what would the result
      be? She would find an easy refuge in positive denial of the truth&mdash;and,
      in that case, which of us would her infatuated husband believe?
    </p>
    <p>
      The one part of the letter which I read with some satisfaction was the end
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was here informed that the Minister&rsquo;s plans for concealing the parentage
      of his adopted daughter had proved to be entirely successful. The members
      of the new domestic household believed the two children to be
      infant-sisters. Neither was there any danger of the adopted child being
      identified (as the oldest child of the two) by consultation of the
      registers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left our town, the Minister had seen for himself that no
      baptismal name had been added, after the birth of the daughter of the
      murderess had been registered, and that no entry of baptism existed in the
      registers kept in places of worship. He drew the inference&mdash;in all
      probability a true inference, considering the characters of the parents&mdash;that
      the child had never been baptized; and he performed the ceremony
      privately, abstaining, for obvious reasons, from adding her Christian name
      to the imperfect register of her birth. &ldquo;I am not aware,&rdquo; he wrote,
      &ldquo;whether I have, or have not, committed an offense against the Law. In any
      case, I may hope to have made atonement by obedience to the Gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six weeks passed, and I heard from my reverend friend once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      His second letter presented a marked contrast to the first. It was written
      in sorrow and anxiety, to inform me of an alarming change for the worse in
      his wife&rsquo;s health. I showed the letter to my medical colleague. After
      reading it he predicted the event that might be expected, in two words:&mdash;Sudden
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next occasion when I heard from the Minister, the Doctor&rsquo;s grim
      reply proved to be a prophecy fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we address expressions of condolence to bereaved friends, the
      principles of popular hypocrisy sanction indiscriminate lying as a duty
      which we owe to the dead&mdash;no matter what their lives may have been&mdash;because
      they are dead. Within my own little sphere, I have always been silent,
      when I could not offer to afflicted persons expressions of sympathy which
      I honestly felt. To have condoled with the Minister on the loss that he
      had sustained by the death of a woman, self-betrayed to me as shamelessly
      deceitful, and pitilessly determined to reach her own cruel ends, would
      have been to degrade myself by telling a deliberate lie. I expressed in my
      answer all that an honest man naturally feels, when he is writing to a
      friend in distress; carefully abstaining from any allusion to the memory
      of his wife, or to the place which her death had left vacant in his
      household. My letter, I am sorry to say, disappointed and offended him. He
      wrote to me no more, until years had passed, and time had exerted its
      influence in producing a more indulgent frame of mind. These letters of a
      later date have been preserved, and will probably be used, at the right
      time, for purposes of explanation with which I may be connected in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondent whom I had now lost was succeeded by a gentleman
      entirely unknown to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those reasons which induced me to conceal the names of persons, while I
      was relating events in the prison, do not apply to correspondence with a
      stranger writing from another place. I may, therefore, mention that Mr.
      Dunboyne, of Fairmount, on the west coast of Ireland, was the writer of
      the letter now addressed to me. He proved, to my surprise, to be one of
      the relations whom the Prisoner under sentence of death had not cared to
      see, when I offered her the opportunity of saying farewell. Mr. Dunboyne
      was a brother-in-law of the murderess. He had married her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, he informed me, had died in childbirth, leaving him but one
      consolation&mdash;a boy, who already recalled all that was brightest and
      best in his lost mother. The father was naturally anxious that the son
      should never become acquainted with the disgrace that had befallen the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter then proceeded in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard yesterday, for the first time, by means of an old
      newspaper-cutting sent to me by a friend, that the miserable woman who
      suffered the ignominy of public execution has left an infant child. Can
      you tell me what has become of the orphan? If this little girl is, as I
      fear, not well provided for, I only do what my wife would have done if she
      had lived, by offering to make the child&rsquo;s welfare my especial care. I am
      willing to place her in an establishment well known to me, in which she
      will be kindly treated, well educated, and fitted to earn her own living
      honorably in later life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel some surprise at finding that my good intentions toward this
      ill-fated niece of mine do not go to the length of receiving her as a
      member of my own family, I beg to submit some considerations which may
      perhaps weigh with you as they have weighed with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, there is at least a possibility&mdash;however
      carefully I might try to conceal it&mdash;that the child&rsquo;s parentage would
      sooner or later be discovered. In the second place (and assuming that the
      parentage had been successfully concealed), if this girl and my boy grew
      up together, there is another possibility to be reckoned with: they might
      become attached to each other. Does the father live who would allow his
      son ignorantly to marry the daughter of a convicted murderess? I should
      have no alternative but to part them cruelly by revealing the truth.&rdquo; The
      letter ended with some complimentary expressions addressed to myself. And
      the question was: how ought I to answer it?
    </p>
    <p>
      My correspondent had strongly impressed me in his favor; I could not doubt
      that he was an honorable man. But the interest of the Minister in keeping
      his own benevolent action secure from the risk of discovery&mdash;increased
      as that interest was by the filial relations of the two children toward
      him, now publicly established&mdash;had, as I could not doubt, the
      paramount claim on me. The absolutely safe course to take was to admit no
      one, friend or stranger, to our confidence. I replied, expressing sincere
      admiration of Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s motives, and merely informing him that the
      child was already provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I heard no more of the Irish gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps hardly necessary to add that I kept the Minister in
      ignorance of my correspondence with Mr. Dunboyne. I was too well
      acquainted with my friend&rsquo;s sensitive and self-tormenting nature to let
      him know that a relative of the murderess was living, and was aware that
      she had left a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      A last event remains to be related, before I close these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the year of which I am now writing, our Chaplain added one more to
      the many examples that I have seen of his generous readiness to serve his
      friends. He had arranged to devote his annual leave of absence to a tour
      among the English Lakes, when he received a letter from a clergyman
      resident in London, whom he had known from the time when they had been
      school-fellows. This old friend wrote under circumstances of the severest
      domestic distress, which made it absolutely necessary that he should leave
      London for a while. Having failed to find a representative who could
      relieve him of his clerical duties, he applied to the Chaplain to
      recommend a clergyman who might be in a position to help him. My excellent
      colleague gave up his holiday-plans without hesitation, and went to London
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return, I asked if he had seen anything of some acquaintances of
      his and of mine, who were then visitors to the metropolis. He smiled
      significantly when he answered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a card to deliver from an acquaintance whom you have not
      mentioned,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I rather think it will astonish you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It simply puzzled me. When he gave me the card, this is what I found
      printed on it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MRS. TENBRUGGEN (OF SOUTH BEVELAND).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the Chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I never even heard of Mrs. Tenbruggen, of South
      Beveland. Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I married the lady to a foreign gentleman, only last week, at my friend&rsquo;s
      church,&rdquo; the Chaplain replied. &ldquo;Perhaps you may remember her maiden name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mentioned the name of the dangerous creature who had first presented
      herself to me, in charge of the Prisoner&rsquo;s child&mdash;otherwise Miss
      Elizabeth Chance. The reappearance of this woman on the scene&mdash;although
      she was only represented by her card&mdash;caused me a feeling of vague
      uneasiness, so contemptibly superstitious in its nature that I now
      remember it with shame. I asked a stupid question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the ordinary course of such things,&rdquo; my friend said. &ldquo;They were
      married by license, in their parish church. The bridegroom was a fine tall
      man, with a bold eye and a dashing manner. The bride and I recognized each
      other directly. When Miss Chance had become Mrs. Tenbruggen, she took me
      aside, and gave me her card. &lsquo;Ask the Governor to accept it,&rsquo; she said,
      &lsquo;in remembrance of the time when he took me for a nursemaid. Tell him I am
      married to a Dutch gentleman of high family. If he ever comes to Holland,
      we shall be glad to see him in our residence at South Beveland.&rsquo; There is
      her message to you, repeated word for word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad she is going to live out of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Surely you have no reason to fear her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking, perhaps, of somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was thinking of the Minister; but it seemed to be safest not to say so.
      &mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My pen is laid aside, and my many pages of writing have been sent to their
      destination. What I undertook to do, is now done. To take a metaphor from
      the stage&mdash;the curtain falls here on the Governor and the Prison.

      CHAPTER XI. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We both said good-night, and went up to our room with a new object in
      view. By our father&rsquo;s advice we had resolved on keeping diaries, for the
      first time in our lives, and had pledged ourselves to begin before we went
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and silently and lazily, my sister sauntered to her end of the room
      and seated herself at her writing-table. On the desk lay a nicely bound
      book, full of blank pages. The word &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; was printed on it in gold
      letters, and there was fitted to the covers a bright brass lock and key. A
      second journal, exactly similar in every respect to the first, was placed
      on the writing-table at my end of the room. I opened my book. The sight of
      the blank leaves irritated me; they were so smooth, so spotless, so
      entirely ready to do <i>their</i> duty. I took too deep a dip of ink, and
      began the first entry in my diary by making a blot. This was discouraging.
      I got up, and looked out of window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My sister&rsquo;s voice could hardly have addressed me in a more weary tone, if
      her pen had been at work all night, relating domestic events. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I
      said. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done already?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed her the blot. My sister Eunice (the strangest as well as the
      dearest of girls) always blurts out what she has in her mind at the time.
      She fixed her eyes gravely on my spoiled page, and said: &ldquo;That comforts
      me.&rdquo; I crossed the room, and looked at her book. She had not even summoned
      energy enough to make a blot. &ldquo;What will papa think of us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
      we don&rsquo;t begin to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not begin,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;by writing down what he said, when he gave
      us our journals? Those wise words of advice will be in their proper place
      on the first page of the new books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not at all a demonstrative girl naturally; not ready with her tears, not
      liberal with her caresses, not fluent in her talk, Eunice was affected by
      my proposal in a manner wonderful to see. She suddenly developed into an
      excitable person&mdash;I declare she kissed me. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;how
      clever you are! The very thing to write about; I&rsquo;ll do it directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She really did it directly; without once stopping to consider, without
      once waiting to ask my advice. Line after line, I heard her noisy pen
      hurrying to the bottom of a first page, and getting three-parts of the way
      toward the end of a second page, before she closed her diary. I reminded
      her that she had not turned the key, in the lock which was intended to
      keep her writing private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth while,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Anybody who cares to do it may read
      what I write. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The singular change which I had noticed in her began to disappear, when
      she set about her preparations for bed. I noticed the old easy indolent
      movements again, and that regular and deliberate method of brushing her
      hair, which I can never contemplate without feeling a stupefying influence
      that has helped me to many a delicious night&rsquo;s sleep. She said her prayers
      in her favorite corner of the room, and laid her head on the pillow with
      the luxurious little sigh which announces that she is falling asleep. This
      reappearance of her usual habits was really a relief to me. Eunice in a
      state of excitement is Eunice exhibiting an unnatural spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I did was to take the liberty which she had already
      sanctioned&mdash;I mean the liberty of reading what she had written. Here
      it is, copied exactly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not half so fond of anybody as I am of papa. He is always kind, he
      is always right. I love him, I love him, I love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not how I meant to begin. I must tell how he talked to us; I
      wish he was here to tell it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said to me: &lsquo;You are getting lazier than ever, Eunice.&rsquo; He said to
      Helena: &lsquo;You are feeling the influence of Eunice&rsquo;s example.&rsquo; He said to
      both of us: &lsquo;You are too ready, my dear children, to sit with your hands
      on your laps, looking at nothing and thinking of nothing; I want to try a
      new way of employing your leisure time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He opened a parcel on the table. He made each of us a present of a
      beautiful book, called &lsquo;Journal.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;When you have nothing to do,
      my dears, in the evening, employ yourselves in keeping a diary of the
      events of the day. It will be a useful record in many ways, and a good
      moral discipline for young girls.&rsquo; Helena said: &lsquo;Oh, thank you!&rsquo; I said
      the same, but not so cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, I feel out of spirits now if I think of papa; I am not easy
      in my mind about him. When he is very much interested, there is a
      quivering in his face which I don&rsquo;t remember in past times. He seems to
      have got older and thinner, all on a sudden. He shouts (which he never
      used to do) when he threatens sinners at sermon-time. Being in dreadful
      earnest about our souls, he is of course obliged to speak of the devil;
      but he never used to hit the harmless pulpit cushion with his fist as he
      does now. Nobody seems to have seen these things but me; and now I have
      noticed them what ought I to do? I don&rsquo;t know; I am certain of nothing,
      except what I have put in at the top of page one: I love him, I love him,
      I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      There this very curious entry ended. It was easy enough to discover the
      influence which had made my slow-minded sister so ready with her memory
      and her pen&mdash;so ready, in short, to do anything and everything,
      provided her heart was in it, and her father was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eunice is wrong, let me tell her, in what she says of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, too, have seen the sad change in my father; but I happen to know that
      he dislikes having it spoken of at home, and I have kept my painful
      discoveries to myself. Unhappily, the best medical advice is beyond our
      reach. The one really competent doctor in this place is known to be an
      infidel. But for that shocking obstacle I might have persuaded my father
      to see him. As for the other two doctors whom he has consulted, at
      different times, one talked about suppressed gout, and the other told him
      to take a year&rsquo;s holiday and enjoy himself on the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock has just struck twelve. I have been writing and copying till my
      eyes are heavy, and I want to follow Eunice&rsquo;s example and sleep as soundly
      as she does. We have made a strange beginning of this journalizing
      experiment. I wonder how long it will go on, and what will come of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND DAY.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begin to be afraid that I am as stupid&mdash;no; that is not a nice word
      to use&mdash;let me say as simple as dear Eunice. A diary means a record
      of the events of the day; and not one of the events of yesterday appears
      in my sister&rsquo;s journal or in mine. Well, it is easy to set that mistake
      right. Our lives are so dull (but I would not say so in my father&rsquo;s
      hearing for the world) that the record of one day will be much the same as
      the record of another. After family prayers and breakfast I suffer my
      customary persecution at the hands of the cook. That is to say, I am
      obliged, being the housekeeper, to order what we have to eat. Oh, how I
      hate inventing dinners! and how I admire the enviable slowness of mind and
      laziness of body which have saved Eunice from undertaking the worries of
      housekeeping in her turn! She can go and work in her garden, while I am
      racking my invention to discover variety in dishes without overstepping
      the limits of economy. I suppose I may confess it privately to myself&mdash;how
      sorry I am not to have been born a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      My next employment leads me to my father&rsquo;s study, to write under his
      dictation. I don&rsquo;t complain of this; it flatters my pride to feel that I
      am helping so great a man. At the same time, I do notice that here again
      Eunice&rsquo;s little defects have relieved her of another responsibility. She
      can neither keep dictated words in her memory, nor has she ever been able
      to learn how to put in her stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dictation, I have an hour&rsquo;s time left for practicing music. My
      sister comes in from the garden, with her pencil and paint-box, and
      practices drawing. Then we go out for a walk&mdash;a delightful walk, if
      my father goes too. He has something always new to tell us, suggested by
      what we pass on the way. Then, dinner-time comes&mdash;not always a
      pleasant part of the day to me. Sometimes I hear paternal complaints
      (always gentle complaints) of my housekeeping; sometimes my sister (I
      won&rsquo;t say the greedy sister) tells me I have not given her enough to eat.
      Poor father! Dear Eunice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner having reached its end, we stroll in the garden when the weather is
      fine. When it rains, we make flannel petticoats for poor old women. What a
      horrid thing old age is to look at! To be ugly, to be helpless, to be
      miserably unfit for all the pleasures of life&mdash;I hope I shall not
      live to be an old woman. What would my father say if he saw this? For his
      sake, to say nothing of my own feelings, I shall do well if I make it a
      custom to use the lock of my journal. Our next occupation is to join the
      Scripture class for girls, and to help the teacher. This is a good
      discipline for Eunice&rsquo;s temper, and&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t deny it!&mdash;for
      my temper, too. I may long to box the ears of the whole class, but it is
      my duty to keep a smiling face and to be a model of patience. From the
      Scripture class we sometimes go to my father&rsquo;s lecture. At other times, we
      may amuse ourselves as well as we can till the tea is ready. After tea, we
      read books which instruct us, poetry and novels being forbidden. When we
      are tired of the books we talk. When supper is over, we have prayers
      again, and we go to bed. There is our day. Oh, dear me! there is our day.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      And how has Eunice succeeded in her second attempt at keeping a diary?
      Here is what she has written. It has one merit that nobody can deny&mdash;it
      is soon read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope papa will excuse me; I have nothing to write about to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over and over again I have tried to point out to my sister the absurdity
      of calling her father by the infantile nickname of papa. I have reminded
      her that she is (in years, at least) no longer a child. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      call him father, as I do?&rdquo; I asked only the other day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made an absurd reply: &ldquo;I used to call him papa when I was a little
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I reminded her, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t justify you in calling him papa now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she actually answered: &ldquo;Yes it does.&rdquo; What a strange state of mind!
      And what a charming girl, in spite of her mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD DAY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning post has brought with it a promise of some little variety in
      our lives&mdash;or, to speak more correctly, in the life of my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our new and nice friends, the Staveleys, have written to invite Eunice to
      pay them a visit at their house in London. I don&rsquo;t complain at being left
      at home. It would be unfilial, indeed, if we both of us forsook our
      father; and last year it was my turn to receive the first invitation, and
      to enjoy the change of scene. The Staveleys are excellent people&mdash;strictly
      pious members of the Methodist Connection&mdash;and exceedingly kind to my
      sister and me. But it was just as well for my moral welfare that I ended
      my visit to our friends when I did. With my fondness for music, I felt the
      temptation of the Evil One trying me, when I saw placards in the street
      announcing that the Italian Opera was open. I had no wish to be a witness
      of the shameful and sinful dancing which goes on (I am told) at the opera;
      but I did feel my principles shaken when I thought of the wonderful
      singers and the entrancing music. And this, when I knew what an atmosphere
      of wickedness people breathe who enter a theater! I reflect with horror on
      what <i>might</i> have happened if I had remained a little longer in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helping Eunice to pack up, I put her journal into the box. &ldquo;You will find
      something to write about now,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;While I record everything that
      happens at home, you will keep your diary of all that you do in London,
      and when you come back we will show each other what we have written.&rdquo; My
      sister is a dear creature. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel sure of being able to do it,&rdquo; she
      answered; &ldquo;but I promise to try.&rdquo; Good Eunice!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The air of London feels very heavy. There is a nasty smell of smoke in
      London. There are too many people in London. They seem to be mostly people
      in a hurry. The head of a country girl, when she goes into the streets,
      turns giddy&mdash;I suppose through not being used to the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do hope that it is London that has put me out of temper. Otherwise, it
      must be I myself who am ill-tempered. I have not yet been one whole day in
      the Staveleys&rsquo; house, and they have offended me already. I don&rsquo;t want
      Helena to hear of this from other people, and then to ask me why I
      concealed it from her. We are to read each other&rsquo;s journals when we are
      both at home again. Let her see what I have to say for myself here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are seven Staveleys in all: Mr. and Mrs. (two); three young Masters
      (five); two young Misses (seven). An eldest miss and the second young
      Master are the only ones at home at the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr., Mrs., and Miss kissed me when I arrived. Young Master only shook
      hands. He looked as if he would have liked to kiss me too. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he? It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered. I don&rsquo;t myself like kissing. What is the
      use of it? Where is the pleasure of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. was so glad to see me; she took hold of me by both hands. She said:
      &ldquo;My dear child, you are improving. You were wretchedly thin when I saw you
      last. Now you are almost as well-developed as your sister. I think you are
      prettier than your sister.&rdquo; Mr. didn&rsquo;t agree to that. He and his wife
      began to dispute about me before my face. I do call that an aggravating
      thing to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. said: &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t got her sister&rsquo;s pretty gray eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. said; &ldquo;She has got pretty brown eyes, which are just as good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. said: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compare her complexion with Helena&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. said: &ldquo;I like Eunice&rsquo;s pale complexion. So delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Miss struck in: &ldquo;I admire Helena&rsquo;s hair&mdash;light brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Master took his turn: &ldquo;I prefer Eunice&rsquo;s hair&mdash;dark brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. opened his great big mouth, and asked a question: &ldquo;Which of you two
      sisters is the oldest? I forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. answered for me: &ldquo;Helena is the oldest; she told us so when she was
      here last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I really could <i>not</i> stand that. &ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; I burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Helena was mistaken.&rdquo; I was unwilling to say of my sister that she
      had been deceiving them, though it did seem only too likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. looked at each other. Mrs. said: &ldquo;You seem to be very
      positive, Eunice. Surely, Helena ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Helena knows a good deal; but she doesn&rsquo;t know which of us is the
      oldest of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. put in another question: &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than Helena does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you keep birthdays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Yes; we keep both our birthdays on the same day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first day of the New Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. tried again: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly be twins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Helena knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. took the next question out of her husband&rsquo;s mouth: &ldquo;Come, come, my
      dear! you must know how old you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do know that. I&rsquo;m eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how old is Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helena&rsquo;s eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. turned round to Mr.: &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. said: &ldquo;I shall write to her father, and ask what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Papa will only tell you what he told us&mdash;years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did your father say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had added our two ages together, and he meant to divide the
      product between us. It&rsquo;s so long since, I don&rsquo;t remember what the product
      was then. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what the product is now. Our two ages come to
      thirty-six. Half thirty-six is eighteen. I get one half, and Helena gets
      the other. When we ask what it means, and when friends ask what it means,
      papa has got the same answer for everybody, &lsquo;I have my reasons.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
      all he says&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no intention of making Mr. angry, but he did get angry. He left off
      speaking to me by my Christian name; he called me by my surname. He said:
      &ldquo;Let me tell you, Miss Gracedieu, it is not becoming in a young lady to
      mystify her elders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had heard that it was respectful in a young lady to call an old
      gentleman, Sir, and to say, If you please. I took care to be respectful
      now. &ldquo;If you please, sir, write to papa. You will find that I have spoken
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman opened the door, and said to Mrs. Staveley: &ldquo;Dinner, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; That
      stopped this nasty exhibition of our tempers. We had a very good dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I wrote to Helena, asking her what she had really said to the
      Staveleys about her age and mine, and telling her what I had said. I found
      it too great a trial of my patience to wait till she could see what I had
      written about the dispute in my journal. The days, since then, have
      passed, and I have been too lazy and stupid to keep my diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day it is different. My head is like a dark room with the light let
      into it. I remember things; I think I can go on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have religious exercises in this house, morning and evening, just as we
      do at home. (Not to be compared with papa&rsquo;s religious exercises.) Two days
      ago his answer came to Mr. Staveley&rsquo;s letter. He did just what I had
      expected&mdash;said I had spoken truly, and disappointed the family by
      asking to be excused if he refrained from entering into explanations. Mr.
      said: &ldquo;Very odd;&rdquo; and Mrs. agreed with him. Young Miss is not quite as
      friendly now as she was at first. And young Master was impudent enough to
      ask me if &ldquo;I had got religion.&rdquo; To conclude the list of my worries, I
      received an angry answer from Helena. &ldquo;Nobody but a simpleton,&rdquo; she wrote,
      &ldquo;would have contradicted me as you did. Who but you could have failed to
      see that papa&rsquo;s strange objection to let it be known which of us is the
      elder makes us ridiculous before other people? My presence of mind
      prevented that. You ought to have been grateful, and held your tongue.&rdquo;
       Perhaps Helena is right&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t feel it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday we went to chapel twice. We also had a sermon read at home, and
      a cold dinner. In the evening, a hot dispute on religion between Mr.
      Staveley and his son. I don&rsquo;t blame them. After being pious all day long
      on Sunday, I have myself felt my piety give way toward evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something pleasant in prospect for to-morrow. All London is going
      just now to the exhibition of pictures. We are going with all London.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with me tonight. I have positively been to
      bed, without going to sleep! After tossing and twisting and trying all
      sorts of positions, I am so angry with myself that I have got up again.
      Rather than do nothing, I have opened my ink-bottle, and I mean to go on
      with my journal. Now I think of it, it seems likely that the exhibition of
      works of art may have upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a dreadfully large number of pictures, matched by a dreadfully
      large number of people to look at them. It is not possible for me to write
      about what I saw: there was too much of it. Besides, the show disappointed
      me. I would rather write about a disagreement (oh, dear, another dispute!)
      I had with Mrs. Staveley. The cause of it was a famous artist; not
      himself, but his works. He exhibited four pictures&mdash;what they call
      figure subjects. Mrs. Staveley had a pencil. At every one of the great
      man&rsquo;s four pictures, she made a big mark of admiration on her catalogue.
      At the fourth one, she spoke to me: &ldquo;Perfectly beautiful, Eunice, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I didn&rsquo;t know. She said: &ldquo;You strange girl, what do you mean by
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been rude not to have given the best answer I could find. I
      said: &ldquo;I never saw the flesh of any person&rsquo;s face like the flesh in the
      faces which that man paints. He reminds me of wax-work. Why does he paint
      the same waxy flesh in all four of his pictures? I don&rsquo;t see the same
      colored flesh in all the faces about us.&rdquo; Mrs. Staveley held up her hand,
      by way of stopping me. She said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so loud, Eunice; you are
      only exposing your own ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice behind us joined in. The voice said: &ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Staveley, if
      I expose <i>my</i> ignorance. I entirely agree with the young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt grateful to the person who took my part, just when I was at a loss
      what to say for myself, and I looked round. The person was a young
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore a beautiful blue frock-coat, buttoned up. I like a frock-coat to
      be buttoned up. He had light-colored trousers and gray gloves and a pretty
      cane. I like light-colored trousers and gray gloves and a pretty cane.
      What color his eyes were is more than I can say; I only know they made me
      hot when they looked at me. Not that I mind being made hot; it is surely
      better than being made cold. He and Mrs. Staveley shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to be old friends. I wished I had been an old friend&mdash;not
      for any bad reason, I hope. I only wanted to shake hands, too. What Mrs.
      Staveley said to him escaped me, somehow. I think the picture escaped me
      also; I don&rsquo;t remember noticing anything except the young gentleman,
      especially when he took off his hat to me. He looked at me twice before he
      went away. I got hot again. I said to Mrs. Staveley: &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at me. I said again: &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;He is young Mr.
      Dunboyne.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Does he live in London?&rdquo; She laughed again. I said
      again: &ldquo;Does he live in London?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;He is here for a holiday; he
      lives with his father at Fairmount, in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Dunboyne&mdash;here for a holiday&mdash;lives with his father at
      Fairmount, in Ireland. I have said that to myself fifty times over. And
      here it is, saying itself for the fifty-first time in my Journal. I must
      indeed be a simpleton, as Helena says. I had better go to bed again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not long before I left home, I heard one of our two servants telling the
      other about a person who had been &ldquo;bewitched.&rdquo; Are you bewitched when you
      don&rsquo;t understand your own self? That has been my curious case, since I
      returned from the picture show. This morning I took my drawing materials
      out of my box, and tried to make a portrait of young Mr. Dunboyne from
      recollection. I succeeded pretty well with his frock-coat and cane; but,
      try as I might, his face was beyond me. I have never drawn anything so
      badly since I was a little girl; I almost felt ready to cry. What a fool I
      am!
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning I received a letter from papa&mdash;it was in reply to a
      letter that I had written to him&mdash;so kind, so beautifully expressed,
      so like himself, that I felt inclined to send him a confession of the
      strange state of feeling that has come over me, and to ask him to comfort
      and advise me. On second thoughts, I was afraid to do it. Afraid of papa!
      I am further away from understanding myself than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunboyne paid us a visit in the afternoon. Fortunately, before we went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I would have a good look at him; so as to know his face better
      than I had known it yet. Another disappointment was in store for me.
      Without intending it, I am sure, he did what no other young man has ever
      done&mdash;he made me feel confused. Instead of looking at him, I sat with
      my head down, and listened to his talk. His voice&mdash;this is high
      praise&mdash;reminded me of papa&rsquo;s voice. It seemed to persuade me as papa
      persuades his congregation. I felt quite at ease again. When he went away,
      we shook hands. He gave my hand a little squeeze. I gave him back the
      squeeze&mdash;without knowing why. When he was gone, I wished I had not
      done it&mdash;without knowing why, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard his Christian name for the first time to-day. Mrs. Staveley said
      to me: &ldquo;We are going to have a dinner-party. Shall I ask Philip Dunboyne?&rdquo;
       I said to Mrs. Staveley: &ldquo;Oh, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is an old woman; her eyes are dim. At times, she can look mischievous.
      She looked at me mischievously now. I wished I had not been so eager to
      have Mr. Dunboyne asked to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fear has come to me that I may have degraded myself. My spirits are
      depressed. This, as papa tells us in his sermons, is a miserable world. I
      am sorry I accepted the Staveleys&rsquo; invitation. I am sorry I went to see
      the pictures. When that young man comes to dinner, I shall say I have got
      a headache, and shall stop upstairs by myself. I don&rsquo;t think I like his
      Christian name. I hate London. I hate everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I wrote up above, yesterday, is nonsense. I think his Christian name
      is perfect. I like London. I love everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to dinner to-day. I sat next to him. How beautiful a dress-coat
      is, and a white cravat! We talked. He wanted to know what my Christian
      name was. I was so pleased when I found he was one of the few people who
      like it. His hair curls naturally. In color, it is something between my
      hair and Helena&rsquo;s. He wears his beard. How manly! It curls naturally, like
      his hair; it smells deliciously of some perfume which is new to me. He has
      white hands; his nails look as if he polished them; I should like to
      polish my nails if I knew how. Whatever I said, he agreed with me; I felt
      satisfied with my own conversation, for the first time in my life. Helena
      won&rsquo;t find me a simpleton when I go home. What exquisite things
      dinner-parties are!
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister told me (when we said good-by) to be particular in writing down
      my true opinion of the Staveleys. Helena wishes to compare what she thinks
      of them with what I think of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My opinion of Mr. Staveley is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like him. My opinion of Miss
      Staveley is&mdash;I can&rsquo;t endure her. As for Master Staveley, my clever
      sister will understand that <i>he</i> is beneath notice. But, oh, what a
      wonderful woman Mrs. Staveley is! We went out together, after luncheon
      today, for a walk in Kensington Gardens. Never have I heard any
      conversation to compare with Mrs. Staveley&rsquo;s. Helena shall enjoy it here,
      at second hand. I am quite changed in two things. First: I think more of
      myself than I ever did before. Second: writing is no longer a difficulty
      to me. I could fill a hundred journals, without once stopping to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley began nicely; &ldquo;I suppose, Eunice, you have often been told
      that you have a good figure, and that you walk well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Helena thinks my figure is better than my face. But do I really
      walk well? Nobody ever told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;Philip Dunboyne thinks so. He said to me, &lsquo;I resist the
      temptation because I might be wanting in respect if I gave way to it. But
      I should like to follow her when she goes out&mdash;merely for the
      pleasure of seeing her walk.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood stockstill. I said nothing. When you are as proud as a peacock
      (which never happened to me before), I find you can&rsquo;t move and can&rsquo;t talk.
      You can only enjoy yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind Mrs. Staveley had more things to tell me. She said: &ldquo;I am interested
      in Philip. I lived near Fairmount in the time before I was married; and in
      those days he was a child. I want him to marry a charming girl, and be
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What made me think directly of Miss Staveley? What made me mad to know if
      she was the charming girl? I was bold enough to ask the question. Mrs.
      Staveley turned to me with that mischievous look which I have noticed
      already. I felt as if I had been running at the top of my speed, and had
      not got my breath again, yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this good motherly friend set me at my ease. She explained herself:
      &ldquo;Philip is not much liked, poor fellow, in our house. My husband considers
      him to be weak and vain and fickle. And my daughter agrees with her
      father. There are times when she is barely civil to Philip. He is too
      good-natured to complain, but <i>I</i> see it. Tell me, my dear, do you
      like Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo; Out it came in those words, before I could stop it. Was
      there something unbecoming to a young lady in saying what I had just said?
      Mrs. Staveley seemed to be more amused than angry with me. She took my arm
      kindly, and led me along with her. &ldquo;My dear, you are as clear as crystal,
      and as true as steel. You are a favorite of mine already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a delightful woman! as I said just now. I asked if she really liked
      me as well as she liked my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;Better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t expect that, and didn&rsquo;t want it. Helena is my superior. She is
      prettier than I am, cleverer than I am, better worth liking than I am.
      Mrs. Staveley shifted the talk back to Philip. I ought to have said Mr.
      Philip. No, I won&rsquo;t; I shall call him Philip. If I had a heart of stone, I
      should feel interested in him, after what Mrs. Staveley has told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a sad story, in some respects. Mother dead; no brothers or sisters.
      Only the father left; he lives a dismal life on a lonely stormy coast. Not
      a severe old gentleman, for all that. His reasons for taking to retirement
      are reasons (so Mrs. Staveley says) which nobody knows. He buries himself
      among his books, in an immense library; and he appears to like it. His son
      has not been brought up like other young men, at school and college. He is
      a great scholar, educated at home by his father. To hear this account of
      his learning depressed me. It seemed to put such a distance between us. I
      asked Mrs. Staveley if he thought me ignorant. As long as I live I shall
      remember the reply: &ldquo;He thinks you charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any other girl would have been satisfied with this. I am the miserable
      creature who is always making mistakes. My stupid curiosity spoiled the
      charm of Mrs. Staveley&rsquo;s conversation. And yet it seemed to be a harmless
      question; I only said I should like to know what profession Philip
      belonged to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley answered: &ldquo;No profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I foolishly put a wrong meaning on this. I said: &ldquo;Is he idle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley laughed. &ldquo;My dear, he is an only son&mdash;and his father is
      a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That stopped me&mdash;at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have enough to live on in comfort at home&mdash;no more. Papa has told
      us himself that he is not (and can never hope to be) a rich man. This is
      not the worst of it. Last year, he refused to marry a young couple, both
      belonging to our congregation. This was very unlike his usual kind self.
      Helena and I asked him for his reasons. They were reasons that did not
      take long to give. The young gentleman&rsquo;s father was a rich man. He had
      forbidden his son to marry a sweet girl&mdash;because she had no fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no fortune. And Philip&rsquo;s father is a rich man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best thing I can do is to wipe my pen, and shut up my Journal, and go
      home by the next train.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a great mind to burn my Journal. It tells me that I had better not
      think of Philip any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      On second thoughts, I won&rsquo;t destroy my Journal; I will only put it away.
      If I live to be an old woman, it may amuse me to open my book again, and
      see how foolish the poor wretch was when she was young.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this aching pain in my heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t remember it at any other time in my life. Is it trouble? How can I
      tell?&mdash;I have had so little trouble. It must be many years since I
      was wretched enough to cry. I don&rsquo;t even understand why I am crying now.
      My last sorrow, so far as I can remember, was the toothache. Other girls&rsquo; 
      mothers comfort them when they are wretched. If my mother had lived&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      useless to think about that. We lost her, while I and my sister were too
      young to understand our misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I had never seen Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems an ungrateful wish. Seeing him at the picture-show was a new
      enjoyment. Sitting next to him at dinner was a happiness that I don&rsquo;t
      recollect feeling, even when Papa has been most sweet and kind to me. I
      ought to be ashamed of myself to confess this. Shall I write to my sister?
      But how should she know what is the matter with me, when I don&rsquo;t know it
      myself? Besides, Helena is angry; she wrote unkindly to me when she
      answered my last letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a dreadful loneliness in this great house at night. I had better
      say my prayers, and try to sleep. If it doesn&rsquo;t make me feel happier, it
      will prevent me spoiling my Journal by dropping tears on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      What an evening of evenings this has been! Last night it was crying that
      kept me awake. To-night I can&rsquo;t sleep for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip called on us again to-day. He brought with him tickets for the
      performance of an Oratorio. Sacred music is not forbidden music among our
      people. Mrs. Staveley and Miss Staveley went to the concert with us.
      Philip and I sat next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister is a musician&mdash;I am nothing. That sounds bitter; but I
      don&rsquo;t mean it so. All I mean is, that I like simple little songs, which I
      can sing to myself by remembering the tune. There, my musical enjoyment
      ends. When voices and instruments burst out together by hundreds, I feel
      bewildered. I also get attacked by fidgets. This last misfortune is sure
      to overtake me when choruses are being performed. The unfortunate people
      employed are made to keep singing the same words, over and over and over
      again, till I find it a perfect misery to listen to them. The choruses
      were unendurable in the performance to-night. This is one of them: &ldquo;Here
      we are all alone in the wilderness&mdash;alone in the wilderness&mdash;in
      the wilderness alone, alone, alone&mdash;here we are in the wilderness&mdash;alone
      in the wilderness&mdash;all all alone in the wilderness,&rdquo; and soon, till I
      felt inclined to call for the learned person who writes Oratorios, and beg
      him to give the poor music a more generous allowance of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I looked at Philip, I found him looking at me. Perhaps he saw
      from the first that the music was wearying music to my ignorant ears. With
      his usual delicacy he said nothing for some time. But when he caught me
      yawning (though I did my best to hide it, for it looked like being
      ungrateful for the tickets), then he could restrain himself no longer. He
      whispered in my ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting tired of this. And so am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to like it,&rdquo; I whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meant, of course, talk in whispers. We were a good deal annoyed&mdash;especially
      when the characters were all alone in the wilderness&mdash;by bursts of
      singing and playing which interrupted us at the most interesting moments.
      Philip persevered with a manly firmness. What could I do but follow his
      example&mdash;at a distance?
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Is it really true that your visit to Mrs. Staveley is coming to
      an end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered: &ldquo;It comes to an end the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sorry to be leaving your friends in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What I might have said if he had made that inquiry a day earlier, when I
      was the most miserable creature living, I would rather not try to guess.
      Being quite happy as things were, I could honestly tell him I was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly be as sorry as I am, Eunice. May I call you by your
      pretty name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eunice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave a blank in my life when you go away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There another chorus stopped him, just as I was eager for more. It was
      such a delightfully new sensation to hear a young gentleman telling me
      that I had left a blank in his life. The next change in the Oratorio
      brought up a young lady, singing alone. Some people behind us grumbled at
      the smallness of her voice. We thought her voice perfect. It seemed to
      lend itself so nicely to our whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Will you help me to think of you while you are away? I want to
      imagine what your life is at home. Do you live in a town or in the
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him the name of our town. When we give a person information, I have
      always heard that we ought to make it complete. So I mentioned our address
      in the town. But I was troubled by a doubt. Perhaps he preferred the
      country. Being anxious about this, I said: &ldquo;Would you rather have heard
      that I live in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live where you may, Eunice, the place will be a favorite place of mine.
      Besides, your town is famous. It has a public attraction which brings
      visitors to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made another of those mistakes which no sensible girl, in my position,
      would have committed. I asked if he alluded to our new market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set me right in the sweetest manner: &ldquo;I alluded to a building hundreds
      of years older than your market-place&mdash;your beautiful cathedral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fancy my not having thought of the cathedral! This is what comes of being
      a Congregationalist. If I had belonged to the Church of England, I should
      have forgotten the market-place, and remembered the cathedral. Not that I
      want to belong to the Church of England. Papa&rsquo;s chapel is good enough for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song sung by the lady with the small voice was so pretty that the
      audience encored it. Didn&rsquo;t Philip and I help them! With the sweetest
      smiles the lady sang it all over again. The people behind us left the
      concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Do you know, I take the greatest interest in cathedrals. I
      propose to enjoy the privilege and pleasure of seeing <i>your</i>
      cathedral early next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had only to look at him to see that I was the cathedral. It was no
      surprise to hear next that he thought of &ldquo;paying his respects to Mr.
      Gracedieu.&rdquo; He begged me to tell him what sort of reception he might hope
      to meet with when he called at our house. I got so excited in doing
      justice to papa that I quite forgot to whisper when the next question
      came. Philip wanted to know if Mr. Gracedieu disliked strangers. When I
      answered, &ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; I said it out loud, so that the people heard me.
      Cruel, cruel people! They all turned round and stared. One hideous old
      woman actually said, &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Miss Staveley looked disgusted. Even kind
      Mrs. Staveley lifted her eyebrows in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, dear Philip, protected and composed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held my hand devotedly till the end of the performance. When he put us
      into the carriage, I was last. He whispered in my ear: &ldquo;Expect me next
      week.&rdquo; Miss Staveley might be as ill-natured as she pleased, on the way
      home. It didn&rsquo;t matter what she said. The Eunice of yesterday might have
      been mortified and offended. The Eunice of to-day was indifferent to the
      sharpest things that could be said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      All through yesterday&rsquo;s delightful evening, I never once thought of
      Philip&rsquo;s father. When I woke this morning, I remembered that old Mr.
      Dunboyne was a rich man. I could eat no breakfast for thinking of the poor
      girl who was not allowed to marry her young gentleman, because she had no
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley waited to speak to me till the rest of them had left us
      together. I had expected her to notice that I looked dull and dismal. No!
      her cleverness got at my secret in quite another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;How do you feel after the concert? You must be hard to please
      indeed if you were not satisfied with the accompaniments last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accompaniments of the Oratorio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. The accompaniments of Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I ought to have laughed. In my miserable state of mind, it was
      not to be done. I said: &ldquo;I hope Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s father will not hear how
      kind he was to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley asked why.
    </p>
    <p>
      My bitterness overflowed at my tongue. I said: &ldquo;Because papa is a poor
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Philip&rsquo;s papa is a rich man,&rdquo; says Mrs. Staveley, putting my own
      thought into words for me. &ldquo;Where do you get these ideas, Eunice? Surely,
      you are not allowed to read novels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have certainly never seen a play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear your head, child, of the nonsense that has got into it&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t think how. Rich Mr. Dunboyne has taught his heir to despise the base
      act of marrying for money. He knows that Philip will meet young ladies at
      my house; and he has written to me on the subject of his son&rsquo;s choice of a
      wife. &lsquo;Let Philip find good principles, good temper, and good looks; and I
      promise beforehand to find the money.&rsquo; There is what he says. Are you
      satisfied with Philip&rsquo;s father, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jumped up in a state of ecstasy. Just as I had thrown my arms round Mrs.
      Staveley&rsquo;s neck, the servant came in with a letter, and handed it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena had written again, on this last day of my visit. Her letter was
      full of instructions for buying things that she wants, before I leave
      London. I read on quietly enough until I came to the postscript. The
      effect of it on me may be told in two words: I screamed. Mrs. Staveley was
      naturally alarmed. &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; she asked. Being quite unable to offer an
      opinion, I read the postscript out loud, and left her to judge for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Helena&rsquo;s news from home:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must prepare you for a surprise, before your return. You will find a
      strange lady established at home. Don&rsquo;t suppose there is any prospect of
      her bidding us good-by, if we only wait long enough. She is already (with
      father&rsquo;s full approval) as much a member of the family as we are. You
      shall form your own unbiased opinion of her, Eunice. For the present, I
      say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked Mrs. Staveley what she thought of my news from home. She said:
      &ldquo;Your father approves of the lady, my dear. I suppose it&rsquo;s good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Staveley did not look as if she believed in the good news, for
      all that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To-day I went as usual to the Scripture-class for girls. It was harder
      work than ever, teaching without Eunice to help me. Indeed, I felt lonely
      all day without my sister. When I got home, I rather hoped that some
      friend might have come to see us, and have been asked to stay to tea. The
      housemaid opened the door to me. I asked Maria if anybody had called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss; a lady, to see the master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw her before, miss, in all my life.&rdquo; I put no more questions.
      Many ladies visit my father. They call it consulting the Minister. He
      advises them in their troubles, and guides them in their religious
      difficulties, and so on. They come and go in a sort of secrecy. So far as
      I know, they are mostly old maids, and they waste the Minister&rsquo;s time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my father came in to tea, I began to feel some curiosity about the
      lady who had called on him. Visitors of that sort, in general, never
      appear to dwell on his mind after they have gone away; he sees too many of
      them, and is too well accustomed to what they have to say. On this
      particular evening, however, I perceived appearances that set me thinking;
      he looked worried and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened, father, to vex you?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the lady concerned in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lady, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who called on you while I was out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you she had called on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked Maria&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Helena, for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank his tea and went back to his study, instead of staying a while,
      and talking pleasantly as usual. My respect submitted to his want of
      confidence in me; but my curiosity was in a state of revolt. I sent for
      Maria, and proceeded to make my own discoveries, with this result:
    </p>
    <p>
      No other person had called at the house. Nothing had happened, except the
      visit of the mysterious lady. &ldquo;She looked between young and old. And, oh
      dear me, she was certainly not pretty. Not dressed nicely, to my mind; but
      they do say dress is a matter of taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Try as I might, I could get no more than that out of our stupid young
      housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening, the cook had occasion to consult me about supper.
      This was a person possessing the advantages of age and experience. I asked
      if she had seen the lady. The cook&rsquo;s reply promised something new: &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t say I saw the lady; but I heard her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you heard her speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss&mdash;crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was she crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the master&rsquo;s study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to hear her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand, miss, that you suspect me of listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is a lie told by a look as bad as a lie told by words? I looked shocked at
      the bare idea of suspecting a respectable person of listening. The cook&rsquo;s
      sense of honor was satisfied; she readily explained herself: &ldquo;I was
      passing the door, miss, on my way upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here my discoveries came to an end. It was certainly possible that an
      afflicted member of my father&rsquo;s congregation might have called on him to
      be comforted. But he sees plenty of afflicted ladies, without looking
      worried and anxious after they leave him. Still suspecting something out
      of the ordinary course of events, I waited hopefully for our next meeting
      at supper-time. Nothing came of it. My father left me by myself again,
      when the meal was over. He is always courteous to his daughters; and he
      made an apology: &ldquo;Excuse me, Helena, I want to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed in a vile humor, and slept badly; wondering, in the long
      wakeful hours, what new rebuff I should meet with on the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast this morning I was agreeably surprised. No signs of anxiety
      showed themselves in my father&rsquo;s face. Instead of retiring to his study
      when we rose from the table, he proposed taking a turn in the garden: &ldquo;You
      are looking pale, Helena, and you will be the better for a little fresh
      air. Besides, I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excitement, I am sure, is good for young women. I saw in his face, I heard
      in his last words, that the mystery of the lady was at last to be
      revealed. The sensation of languor and fatigue which follows a disturbed
      night left me directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father gave me his arm, and we walked slowly up and down the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When that lady called on me yesterday,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you wanted to know who
      she was, and you were surprised and disappointed when I refused to gratify
      your curiosity. My silence was not a selfish silence, Helena. I was
      thinking of you and your sister; and I was at a loss how to act for the
      best. You shall hear why my children were in my mind, presently. I must
      tell you first that I have arrived at a decision; I hope and believe on
      reasonable grounds. Ask me any questions you please; my silence will be no
      longer an obstacle in your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was so very encouraging that I said at once: &ldquo;I should like to know
      who the lady is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady is related to me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We are cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a disclosure that I had not anticipated. In the little that I
      have seen of the world, I have observed that cousins&mdash;when they
      happen to be brought together under interesting circumstances&mdash;can
      remember their relationship, and forget their relationship, just as it
      suits them. &ldquo;Is your cousin a married lady?&rdquo; I ventured to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Short as it was, that reply might perhaps mean more than appeared on the
      surface. The cook had heard the lady crying. What sort of tender agitation
      was answerable for those tears? Was it possible, barely possible, that
      Eunice and I might go to bed, one night, a widower&rsquo;s daughters, and wake
      up the next day to discover a stepmother?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I or my sister ever seen the lady?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. She has been living abroad; and I have not seen her myself since
      we were both young people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My excellent innocent father! Not the faintest idea of what I had been
      thinking of was in his mind. Little did he suspect how welcome was the
      relief that he had afforded to his daughter&rsquo;s wicked doubts of him. But he
      had not said a word yet about his cousin&rsquo;s personal appearance. There
      might be remains of good looks which the housemaid was too stupid to
      discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the long interval that has passed since you met,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
      suppose she has become an old woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. Let us say, a middle-aged woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she is still an attractive person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;I am afraid, Helena, that would never have been a very
      accurate description of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now knew all that I wanted to know about this alarming person, excepting
      one last morsel of information which my father had strangely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been talking about the lady for some time,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and you have
      not yet told me her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father looked a little embarrassed &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a very pretty name,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;My cousin, my unfortunate cousin, is&mdash;Miss Jillgall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I burst out with such a loud &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; that he laughed. I caught the
      infection, and laughed louder still. Bless Miss Jillgall! The interview
      promised to become an easy one for both of us, thanks to her name. I was
      in good spirits, and I made no attempt to restrain them. &ldquo;The next time
      Miss Jillgall honors you with a visit,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you must give me an
      opportunity of being presented to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a strange reply: &ldquo;You may find your opportunity, Helena, sooner
      than you anticipate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did this mean that she was going to call again in a day or two? I am
      afraid I spoke flippantly. I said: &ldquo;Oh, father, another lady fascinated by
      the popular preacher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The garden chairs were near us. He signed to me gravely to be seated by
      his side, and said to himself: &ldquo;This is my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your fault?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left you in ignorance, my dear, of my cousin&rsquo;s sad story. It is
      soon told; and, if it checks your merriment, it will make amends by
      deserving your sympathy. I was indebted to her father, when I was a boy,
      for acts of kindness which I can never forget. He was twice married. The
      death of his first wife left him with one child&mdash;once my playfellow;
      now the lady whose visit has excited your curiosity. His second wife was a
      Belgian. She persuaded him to sell his business in London, and to invest
      the money in a partnership with a brother of hers, established as a
      sugar-refiner at Antwerp. The little daughter accompanied her father to
      Belgium. Are you attending to me, Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was waiting for the interesting part of the story, and was wondering
      when he would get to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As time went on,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;the new partner found that the value of
      the business at Antwerp had been greatly overrated. After a long struggle
      with adverse circumstances, he decided on withdrawing from the partnership
      before the whole of his capital was lost in a failing commercial
      speculation. The end of it was that he retired, with his daughter, to a
      small town in East Flanders; the wreck of his property having left him
      with an income of no more than two hundred pounds a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed my father that I was attending to him now, by inquiring what had
      become of the Belgian wife. Those nervous quiverings, which Eunice has
      mentioned in her diary, began to appear in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too shameful a story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be told to a young girl. The
      marriage was dissolved by law; and the wife was the person to blame. I am
      sure, Helena, you don&rsquo;t wish to hear any more of <i>this</i> part of the
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did wish. But I saw that he expected me to say No&mdash;so I said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father and daughter,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;never so much as thought of
      returning to their own country. They were too poor to live comfortably in
      England. In Belgium their income was sufficient for their wants. On the
      father&rsquo;s death, the daughter remained in the town. She had friends there,
      and friends nowhere else; and she might have lived abroad to the end of
      her days, but for a calamity to which we are all liable. A long and
      serious illness completely prostrated her. Skilled medical attendance,
      costing large sums of money for the doctors&rsquo; traveling expenses, was
      imperatively required. Experienced nurses, summoned from a distant
      hospital, were in attendance night and day. Luxuries, far beyond the reach
      of her little income, were absolutely required to support her wasted
      strength at the time of her tedious recovery. In one word, her resources
      were sadly diminished, when the poor creature had paid her debts, and had
      regained her hold on life. At that time, she unhappily met with the man
      who has ruined her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was getting interesting at last. &ldquo;Ruined her?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Do you mean
      that he robbed her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Helena, is exactly what I mean&mdash;and many and many a helpless
      woman has been robbed in the same way. The man of whom I am now speaking
      was a lawyer in large practice. He bore an excellent character, and was
      highly respected for his exemplary life. My cousin (not at all a discreet
      person, I am bound to admit) was induced to consult him on her pecuniary
      affairs. He expressed the most generous sympathy&mdash;offered to employ
      her little capital in his business&mdash;and pledged himself to pay her
      double the interest for her money, which she had been in the habit of
      receiving from the sound investment chosen by her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course he got the money, and never paid the interest?&rdquo; Eager to
      hear the end, I interrupted the story in those inconsiderate words. My
      father&rsquo;s answer quietly reproved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He paid the interest regularly as long as he lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened when he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died a bankrupt; the secret profligacy of his life was at last
      exposed. Nothing, actually nothing, was left for his creditors. The
      unfortunate creature, whose ugly name has amused you, must get help
      somewhere, or must go to the workhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I had been in a state of mind to attend to trifles, this would have
      explained the reason why the cook had heard Miss Jillgall crying. But the
      prospect before me&mdash;the unendurable prospect of having a strange
      woman in the house&mdash;had showed itself too plainly to be mistaken. I
      could think of nothing else. With infinite difficulty I assumed a
      momentary appearance of composure, and suggested that Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s
      foreign friends might have done something to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father defended her foreign friends. &ldquo;My dear, they were poor people,
      and did all they could afford to do. But for their kindness, my cousin
      might not have been able to return to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to cast herself on your mercy,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;in the character of a
      helpless woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Helena! Not to cast herself on my mercy&mdash;but to find my house
      open to her, as her father&rsquo;s house was open to me in the bygone time. I am
      her only surviving relative; and, while I live, she shall not be a
      helpless woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to wish that I had not spoken out so plainly. My father&rsquo;s sweet
      temper&mdash;I do so sincerely wish I had inherited it!&mdash;made the
      kindest allowances for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand the momentary bitterness of feeling that has escaped you,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;I may almost say that I expected it. My only hesitation in this
      matter has been caused by my sense of what I owe to my children. It was
      putting your endurance, and your sister&rsquo;s endurance, to a trial to expect
      you to receive a stranger (and that stranger not a young girl like
      yourselves) as one of the household, living with you in the closest
      intimacy of family life. The consideration which has decided me does
      justice, I hope, to you and Eunice, as well as to myself. I think that
      some allowance is due from my daughters to the father who has always made
      loving allowance for <i>them</i>. Am I wrong in believing that my good
      children have not forgotten this, and have only waited for the occasion to
      feel the pleasure of rewarding me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was beautifully put. There was but one thing to be done&mdash;I kissed
      him. And there was but one thing to be said. I asked at what time we might
      expect to receive Miss Jillgall. &ldquo;She is staying, Helena, at a small hotel
      in the town. I have already sent to say that we are waiting to see her.
      Perhaps you will look at the spare bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be got ready, father, directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran into the house; I rushed upstairs into the room that is Eunice&rsquo;s and
      mine; I locked the door, and then I gave way to my rage, before it stifled
      me. I stamped on the floor, I clinched my fists, I cast myself on the bed,
      I reviled that hateful woman by every hard word that I could throw at her.
      Oh, the luxury of it! the luxury of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold water and my hairbrush soon made me fit to be seen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the spare room, it looked a great deal too comfortable for an
      incubus from foreign parts. The one improvement that I could have made, if
      a friend of mine had been expected, was suggested by the window-curtains.
      I was looking at a torn place in one of them, and determined to leave it
      unrepaired, when I felt an arm slipped round my waist from behind. A
      voice, so close that it tickled my neck, said: &ldquo;Dear girl, what friends we
      shall be!&rdquo; I turned round, and confronted Miss Jillgall.

      CHAPTER XV. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If I am not a good girl, where is a good girl to be found? This is in
      Eunice&rsquo;s style. It sometimes amuses me to mimic my simple sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just torn three pages out of my diary, in deference to the
      expression of my father&rsquo;s wishes. He took the first opportunity which his
      cousin permitted him to enjoy of speaking to me privately; and his object
      was to caution me against hastily relying on first impressions of anybody&mdash;especially
      of Miss Jillgall. &ldquo;Wait for a day or two,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and then form your
      estimate of the new member of our household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stormy state of my temper had passed away, and had left my atmosphere
      calm again. I could feel that I had received good advice; but unluckily it
      reached me too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had formed my estimate of Miss Jillgall, and had put it in writing for
      my own satisfaction, at least an hour before my father found himself at
      liberty to speak to me. I don&rsquo;t agree with him in distrusting first
      impressions; and I had proposed to put my opinion to the test, by
      referring to what I had written about his cousin at a later time. However,
      after what he had said to me, I felt bound in filial duty to take the
      pages out of my book, and to let two days pass before I presumed to enjoy
      the luxury of hating Miss Jillgall. On one thing I am determined: Eunice
      shall not form a hasty opinion, either. She shall undergo the same severe
      discipline of self-restraint to which her sister is obliged to submit. Let
      us be just, as somebody says, before we are generous. No more for to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      I open my diary again&mdash;after the prescribed interval has elapsed. The
      first impression produced on me by the new member of our household remains
      entirely unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I already made the remark that, when one removes a page from a book,
      it does not necessarily follow that one destroys the page afterward? or
      did I leave this to be inferred? In either case, my course of proceeding
      was the same. I ordered some paste to be made. Then I unlocked a drawer,
      and found my poor ill-used leaves, and put them back in my Journal. An act
      of justice is surely not the less praiseworthy because it is an act of
      justice done to one&rsquo;s self.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father has often told me that he revises his writings on religious
      subjects. I may harmlessly imitate that good example, by revising my
      restored entry. It is now a sufficiently remarkable performance to be
      distinguished by a title. Let me call it:
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressions of Miss Jillgall. My first impression was a strong one&mdash;it
      was produced by the state of this lady&rsquo;s breath. In other words, I was
      obliged to let her kiss me. It is a duty to be considerate toward human
      infirmity. I will only say that I thought I should have fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second impression draws a portrait, and produces a striking likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure, little and lean&mdash;hair of a dirty drab color which we see in
      string&mdash;small light gray eyes, sly and restless, and deeply sunk in
      the head&mdash;prominent cheekbones, and a florid complexion&mdash;an
      inquisitive nose, turning up at the end&mdash;a large mouth and a servile
      smile&mdash;raw-looking hands, decorated with black mittens&mdash;a
      misfitting white jacket and a limp skirt&mdash;manners familiar&mdash;temper
      cleverly hidden&mdash;voice too irritating to be mentioned. Whose portrait
      is this? It is the portrait of Miss Jillgall, taken in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her true character is not easy to discover; I suspect that it will only
      show itself little by little. That she is a born meddler in other people&rsquo;s
      affairs, I think I can see already. I also found out that she trusted to
      flattery as the easiest means of making herself agreeable. She tried her
      first experiment on myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You charming girl,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;your bright face encourages me to ask a
      favor. Pray make me useful! The one aspiration of my life is to be useful.
      Unless you employ me in that way, I have no right to intrude myself into
      your family circle. Yes, yes, I know that your father has opened his house
      and his heart to me. But I dare not found any claim&mdash;your name is
      Helena, isn&rsquo;t it? Dear Helena, I dare not found any claim on what I owe to
      your father&rsquo;s kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your father is not a man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was rude enough to interrupt her: &ldquo;What is he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An angel,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall answered, solemnly. &ldquo;A destitute earthly
      creature like me must not look up as high as your father. I might be
      dazzled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was rather more than I could endure patiently. &ldquo;Let us try,&rdquo; I
      suggested, &ldquo;if we can&rsquo;t understand each other, at starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s little eyes twinkled in their bony caverns. &ldquo;The very
      thing I was going to propose!&rdquo; she burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I went on; &ldquo;then, let me tell you plainly that flattery is
      not relished in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flattery?&rdquo; She put her hand to her head as she repeated the word, and
      looked quite bewildered. &ldquo;Dear Helena, I have lived all my life in East
      Flanders, and my own language is occasionally strange to me. Can you tell
      me what flattery is in Flemish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand Flemish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very provoking! You don&rsquo;t understand Flemish, and I don&rsquo;t understand
      Flattery. I should so like to know what it means. Ah, I see books in this
      lovely room. Is there a dictionary among them?&rdquo; She darted to the
      bookcase, and discovered a dictionary. &ldquo;Now I shall understand Flattery,&rdquo;
       she remarked&mdash;&ldquo;and then we shall understand each other. Oh, let me
      find it for myself!&rdquo; She ran her raw red finger along the alphabetical
      headings at the top of each page. &ldquo;&lsquo;FAD.&rsquo; That won&rsquo;t do. &lsquo;FIE.&rsquo; Further on
      still. &lsquo;FLE.&rsquo; Too far the other way. &lsquo;FLA.&rsquo; Here we are! &lsquo;Flattery: False
      praise. Commendation bestowed for the purpose of gaining favor and
      influence.&rsquo; Oh, Helena, how cruel of you!&rdquo; She dropped the book, and sank
      into a chair&mdash;the picture, if such a thing can be, of a
      broken-hearted old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should most assuredly have taken the opportunity of leaving her to her
      own devices, if I had been free to act as I pleased. But my interests as a
      daughter forbade me to make an enemy of my father&rsquo;s cousin, on the first
      day when she had entered the house. I made an apology, very neatly
      expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up&mdash;let me do her justice; Miss Jillgall is as nimble as a
      monkey&mdash;and (Faugh!) she kissed me for the second time. If I had been
      a man, I am afraid I should have called for that deadly poison (we are all
      temperance people in this house) known by the name of Brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will make me love you,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall explained, &ldquo;you must expect
      to be kissed. Dear girl, let us go back to my poor little petition. Oh, do
      make me useful! There are so many things I can do: you will find me a
      treasure in the house. I write a good hand; I understand polishing
      furniture; I can dress hair (look at my own hair); I play and sing a
      little when people want to be amused; I can mix a salad and knit stockings&mdash;who
      is this?&rdquo; The cook came in, at the moment, to consult me; I introduced
      her. &ldquo;And, oh,&rdquo; cried Miss Jillgall, in ecstasy, &ldquo;I can cook! Do, please,
      let me see the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook&rsquo;s face turned red. She had come to me to make a confession; and
      she had not (as she afterward said) bargained for the presence of a
      stranger. For the first time in her life she took the liberty of
      whispering to me: &ldquo;I must ask you, miss, to let me send up the cauliflower
      plain boiled; I don&rsquo;t understand the directions in the book for doing it
      in the foreign way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s ears&mdash;perhaps because they are so large&mdash;possess
      a quickness of hearing quite unparalleled in my experience. Not one word
      of the cook&rsquo;s whispered confession had escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;is an opportunity of making myself useful! What is
      the cook&rsquo;s name? Hannah? Take me downstairs, Hannah, and I&rsquo;ll show you how
      to do the cauliflower in the foreign way. She seems to hesitate. Is it
      possible that she doesn&rsquo;t believe me? Listen, Hannah, and judge for
      yourself if I am deceiving you. Have you boiled the cauliflower? Very
      well; this is what you must do next. Take four ounces of grated cheese,
      two ounces of best butter, the yolks of four eggs, a little bit of glaze,
      lemon-juice, nutmeg&mdash;dear, dear, how black she looks. What have I
      said to offend her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook passed over the lady who had presumed to instruct her, as if no
      such person had been present, and addressed herself to me: &ldquo;If I am to be
      interfered with in my own kitchen, miss, I will ask you to suit yourself
      at a month&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall wrung her hands in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant so kindly,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I seem to have made mischief. With the
      best intentions, Helena, I have set you and your servant at variance. I
      really didn&rsquo;t know you had such a temper, Hannah,&rdquo; she declared, following
      the cook to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nothing I am not ready to do to
      make it up with you. Perhaps you have not got the cheese downstairs? I&rsquo;m
      ready to go out and buy it for you. I could show you how to keep eggs
      sweet and fresh for weeks together. Your gown doesn&rsquo;t fit very well; I
      shall be glad to improve it, if you will leave it out for me after you
      have gone to bed. There!&rdquo; cried Miss Jillgall, as the cook majestically
      left the room, without even looking at her, &ldquo;I have done my best to make
      it up, and you see how my advances are received. What more could I have
      done? I really ask you, dear, as a friend, what more <i>could</i> I have
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had it on the tip of my tongue to say: &ldquo;The cook doesn&rsquo;t ask you to buy
      cheese for her, or to teach her how to keep eggs, or to improve the fit of
      her gown; all she wants is to have her kitchen to herself.&rdquo; But here again
      it was necessary to remember that this odious person was my father&rsquo;s
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t distress yourself,&rdquo; I began; &ldquo;I am sure you are not to blame,
      Miss Jillgall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Miss Jillgall. I call you Helena. Call me Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had really not supposed it possible that she could be more unendurable
      than ever. When she mentioned her Christian name, she succeeded
      nevertheless in producing that result. In the whole list of women&rsquo;s names,
      is there any one to be found so absolutely sickening as &ldquo;Selina&rdquo;? I forced
      myself to pronounce it; I made another neatly-expressed apology; I said
      English servants were so very peculiar. Selina was more than satisfied;
      she was quite delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that it, indeed? An explanation was all I wanted. How good of you! And
      now tell me&mdash;is there no chance, in the house or out of the house, of
      my making myself useful? Oh, what&rsquo;s that? Do I see a chance? I do! I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s eyes are more than mortal. At one time, they are
      microscopes. At another time, they are telescopes. She discovered (right
      across the room) the torn place in the window-curtain. In an instant, she
      snatched a dirty little leather case out of her pocket, threaded her
      needle and began darning the curtain. She sang over her work. &ldquo;My heart is
      light, my will is free&mdash;&rdquo; I can repeat no more of it. When I heard
      her singing voice, I became reckless of consequences, and ran out of the
      room with my hands over my ears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I reached the foot of the stairs, my father called me into his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him at his writing-table, with such a heap of torn-up paper in his
      waste-basket that it overflowed on to the floor. He explained to me that
      he had been destroying a large accumulation of old letters, and had ended
      (when his employment began to grow wearisome) in examining his
      correspondence rather carelessly. The result was that he had torn up a
      letter, and a copy of the reply, which ought to have been set aside as
      worthy of preservation. After collecting the fragments, he had heaped them
      on the table. If I could contrive to put them together again on fair
      sheets of paper, and fasten them in their right places with gum, I should
      be doing him a service, at a time when he was too busy to set his mistake
      right for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the best excuse that I could desire for keeping out of Miss
      Jillgall&rsquo;s way. I cheerfully set to work on the restoration of the
      letters, while my father went on with his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having put the fragments together&mdash;excepting a few gaps caused by
      morsels that had been lost&mdash;I was unwilling to fasten them down with
      gum, until I could feel sure of not having made any mistakes; especially
      in regard to some of the lost words which I had been obliged to restore by
      guess-work. So I copied the letters, and submitted them, in the first
      place, to my father&rsquo;s approval. He praised me in the prettiest manner for
      the care that I had taken. But, when he began, after some hesitation, to
      read my copy, I noticed a change. The smile left his face, and the nervous
      quiverings showed themselves again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, my child,&rdquo; he said, in low sad tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to my side of the table, I expected to see him resume his
      writing. He crossed the room to the window and stood (with his back to me)
      looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had first discovered the sense of the letters, they failed to
      interest me. A tiresome woman, presuming on the kindness of a good-natured
      man to beg a favor which she had no right to ask, and receiving a refusal
      which she had richly deserved, was no remarkable event in my experience as
      my father&rsquo;s secretary and copyist. But the change in his face, while he
      read the correspondence, altered my opinion of the letters. There was more
      in them evidently than I had discovered. I kept my manuscript copy&mdash;here
      it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      From Miss Elizabeth Chance to the Rev. Abel Gracedieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Date of year, 1859. Date of month, missing.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;You have, I hope, not quite forgotten the interesting
      conversation that we had last year in the Governor&rsquo;s rooms. I am afraid I
      spoke a little flippantly at the time; but I am sure you will believe me
      when I say that this was out of no want of respect to yourself. My
      pecuniary position being far from prosperous, I am endeavoring to obtain
      the vacant situation of housekeeper in a public institution the prospectus
      of which I inclose. You will see it is a rule of the place that a
      candidate must be a single woman (which I am), and must be recommended by
      a clergyman. You are the only reverend gentleman whom it is my good
      fortune to know, and the thing is of course a mere formality. Pray excuse
      this application, and oblige me by acting as my reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ELIZABETH CHANCE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Please address: Miss E. Chance, Poste Restante, St.
      Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Rev. Abel Gracedieu to Miss Chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Copy.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADAM&mdash;The brief conversation to which your letter alludes, took
      place at an accidental meeting between us. I then saw you for the first
      time, and I have not seen you since. It is impossible for me to assert the
      claim of a perfect stranger, like yourself, to fill a situation of trust.
      I must beg to decline acting as your reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ABEL GRACEDIEU.&rdquo; .......
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was still at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that idle position he could hardly complain of me for interrupting him,
      if I ventured to talk about the letters which I had put together. If my
      curiosity displeased him, he had only to say so, and there would be an end
      to any allusions of mine to the subject. My first idea was to join him at
      the window. On reflection, and still perceiving that he kept his back
      turned on me, I thought it might be more prudent to remain at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Miss Chance seems to be an impudent person?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she a young woman, when you met with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a woman to look at? Ugly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here were three answers which Eunice herself would have been quick enough
      to interpret as three warnings to say no more. I felt a little hurt by his
      keeping his back turned on me. At the same time, and naturally, I think, I
      found my interest in Miss Chance (I don&rsquo;t say my friendly interest)
      considerably increased by my father&rsquo;s unusually rude behavior. I was also
      animated by an irresistible desire to make him turn round and look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Chance&rsquo;s letter was written many years ago,&rdquo; I resumed. &ldquo;I wonder
      what has become of her since she wrote to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even whether she is alive or dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that. What do these questions mean, Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I declare he looked as if he suspected me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak out?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have I ever taught you to conceal
      your thoughts? Have I ever been a hard father, who discouraged you when
      you wished to confide in him? What are you thinking about? Do <i>you</i>
      know anything of this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, what a question! I never even heard of her till I put the
      torn letters together. I begin to wish you had not asked me to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. It never struck me that you would feel such extraordinary&mdash;I
      had almost said, such vulgar&mdash;curiosity about a worthless letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This roused my temper. When a young lady is told that she is vulgar, if
      she has any self-conceit&mdash;I mean self-respect&mdash;she feels
      insulted. I said something sharp in my turn. It was in the way of
      argument. I do not know how it may be with other young persons, I never
      reason so well myself as when I am angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call it a worthless letter,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and yet you think it worth
      preserving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing more to say to me than that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed again. After having looked unaccountably angry, he now looked
      unaccountably relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will soon satisfy you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have a good reason for
      preserving a worthless letter. Miss Chance, my dear, is not a woman to be
      trusted. If she saw her advantage in making a bad use of my reply, I am
      afraid she would not hesitate to do it. Even if she is no longer living, I
      don&rsquo;t know into what vile hands my letter may not have fallen, or how it
      might be falsified for some wicked purpose. Do you see now how a
      correspondence may become accidentally important, though it is of no value
      in itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to this with a safe conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were some perplexities still left in my mind. It seemed strange
      that Miss Chance should (apparently) have submitted to the severity of my
      father&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I should have thought,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;that she would
      have sent you another impudent letter&mdash;or perhaps have insisted on
      seeing you, and using her tongue instead of her pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could do neither the one nor the other, Helena. Miss Chance will
      never find out my address again; I have taken good care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a loud voice, with a flushed face&mdash;as if it was quite a
      triumph to have prevented this woman from discovering his address. What
      reason could he have for being so anxious to keep her away from him? Could
      I venture to conclude that there was a mystery in the life of a man so
      blameless, so truly pious? It shocked one even to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence between us, to which the housemaid offered a welcome
      interruption. Dinner was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed me before we left the room. &ldquo;One word more, Helena,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and I have done. Let there be no more talk between us about Elizabeth
      Chance.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall joined us at the dinner-table, in a state of excitement,
      carrying a book in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inclined, on reflection, to suspect that she is quite clever enough
      to have discovered that I hate her&mdash;and that many of the aggravating
      things she says and does are assumed, out of retaliation, for the purpose
      of making me angry. That ugly face is a double face, or I am much
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the dinner-table, Miss Jillgall addressed herself, with an
      air of playful penitence, to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear cousin, I hope I have not done wrong. Helena left me all by myself.
      When I had finished darning the curtain, I really didn&rsquo;t know what to do.
      So I opened all the bedroom doors upstairs and looked into the rooms. In
      the big room with two beds&mdash;oh, I am so ashamed&mdash;I found this
      book. Please look at the first page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father looked at the title-page: &ldquo;Doctor Watts&rsquo;s Hymns. Well, Selina,
      what is there to be ashamed of in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! no! It&rsquo;s the wrong page. Do look at the other page&mdash;the one
      that comes first before that one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My patient father turned to the blank page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;my other daughter&rsquo;s name is written in it&mdash;the
      daughter whom you have not seen. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall clasped her hands distractedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ignorance I&rsquo;m so
      ashamed of. Dear cousin, forgive me, enlighten me. I don&rsquo;t know how to
      pronounce your other daughter&rsquo;s name. Do you call her Euneece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was getting cold. I was provoked into saying: &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had evidently not forgiven me for leaving her by herself. &ldquo;Pardon me,
      Helena, when I want information I don&rsquo;t apply to you: I sit, as it were,
      at the feet of your learned father. Dear cousin, is it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even my father declined to wait for his dinner any longer. &ldquo;Pronounce it
      as you like, Selina. Here we say Euni&rsquo;ce&mdash;with the accent on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; 
      and with the final &lsquo;e&rsquo; sounded: Eu-ni&rsquo;-see. Let me give you some soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall groaned. &ldquo;Oh, how difficult it seems to be! Quite beyond my
      poor brains! I shall ask the dear girl&rsquo;s leave to call her Euneece. What
      very strong soup! Isn&rsquo;t it rather a waste of meat? Give me a little more,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I discovered another of Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s peculiarities. Her appetite was
      enormous, and her ways were greedy. You heard her eat her soup. She
      devoured the food on her plate with her eyes before she put it into her
      mouth; and she criticised our English cookery in the most impudent manner,
      under pretense of asking humbly how it was done. There was, however, some
      temporary compensation for this. We had less of her talk while she was
      eating her dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the removal of the cloth, she recovered the use of her tongue; and
      she hit on the one subject of all others which proves to be the sorest
      trial to my father&rsquo;s patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, dear cousin, let us talk of your other daughter, our absent
      Euneece. I do so long to see her. When is she coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad I am! And do tell me&mdash;which is she? Your oldest girl or
      your youngest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither the one nor the other, Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my head! my head! This is even worse than the accent on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; and
      the final &lsquo;e.&rsquo; Stop! I am cleverer than I thought I was. You mean that the
      girls are twins. Are they both so exactly like each other that I shan&rsquo;t
      know which is which? What fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the subject of our ages was unluckily started at Mrs. Staveley&rsquo;s, I
      had slipped out of the difficulty easily by assuming the character of the
      eldest sister&mdash;an example of ready tact which my dear stupid Eunice
      doesn&rsquo;t understand. In my father&rsquo;s presence, it is needless to say that I
      kept silence, and left it to him. I was sorry to be obliged to do this.
      Owing to his sad state of health, he is easily irritated&mdash;especially
      by inquisitive strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave you,&rdquo; he answered, without taking the slightest notice of
      what Miss Jillgall had said to him. &ldquo;My work is waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him on his way to the door. &ldquo;Oh, tell me&mdash;can&rsquo;t I help
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but tell me one thing. Am I right about the twins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s demonstrative hands flew up into the air again, and
      expressed the climax of astonishment by quivering over her head. &ldquo;This is
      positively maddening,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice, cousin. Don&rsquo;t attempt to find out what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room. Miss Jillgall appealed to me. I imitated my father&rsquo;s
      wise brevity of expression: &ldquo;Sorry to disappoint you, Selina; I know no
      more about it than you do. Come upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every step of the way up to the drawing-room was marked by a protest or an
      inquiry. Did I expect her to believe that I couldn&rsquo;t say which of us was
      the elder of the two? that I didn&rsquo;t really know what my father&rsquo;s motive
      was for this extraordinary mystification? that my sister and I had
      submitted to be robbed, as it were, of our own ages, and had not insisted
      on discovering which of us had come into the world first? that our friends
      had not put an end to this sort of thing by comparing us personally, and
      discovering which was the elder sister by investigation of our faces? To
      all this I replied: First, that I did certainly expect her to believe
      whatever I might say: Secondly, that what she was pleased to call the
      &ldquo;mystification&rdquo; had begun when we were both children; that habit had made
      it familiar to us in the course of years; and above all, that we were too
      fond of our good father to ask for explanations which we knew by
      experience would distress him: Thirdly, that friends did try to discover,
      by personal examination, which was the elder sister, and differed
      perpetually in their conclusions; also that we had amused ourselves by
      trying the same experiment before our looking-glasses, and that Eunice
      thought Helena was the oldest, and Helena thought Eunice was the oldest:
      Fourthly (and finally), that the Reverend Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s cousin had
      better drop the subject, unless she was bent on making her presence in the
      house unendurable to the Reverend Mr. Gracedieu himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write it with a sense of humiliation; Miss Jillgall listened attentively
      to all I had to say&mdash;and then took me completely by surprise. This
      inquisitive, meddlesome, restless, impudent woman suddenly transformed
      herself into a perfect model of amiability and decorum. She actually said
      she agreed with me, and was much obliged for my good advice!
    </p>
    <p>
      A stupid young woman, in my place, would have discovered that this was not
      natural, and that Miss Jillgall was presenting herself to me in disguise,
      to reach some secret end of her own. I am not a stupid young woman; I
      ought to have had at my service penetration enough to see through and
      through Cousin Selina. Well! Cousin Selina was an impenetrable mystery to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing to be done was to watch her. I was at least sly enough to
      take up a book, and pretend to be reading it. How contemptible!
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round the room, and discovered our pretty writing-table; a
      present to my father from his congregation. After a little consideration,
      she sat down to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does the post go out?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned the hour; and she began her letter. Before she could have
      written more than the first two or three lines, she turned round on her
      seat, and began talking to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like writing letters, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but then I have not many letters to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a few friends, Helena, but those few worthy to be loved? My own case
      exactly. Has your father told you of my troubles? Ah, I am glad of that.
      It spares me the sad necessity of confessing what I have suffered. Oh, how
      good my friends, my new friends, were to me in that dull little Belgian
      town! One of them was generosity personified&mdash;ah, she had suffered,
      too! A vile husband who had deceived and deserted her. Oh, the men! When
      she heard of the loss of my little fortune, that noble creature got up a
      subscription for me, and went round herself to collect. Think of what I
      owe to her! Ought I to let another day pass without writing to my
      benefactress? Am I not bound in gratitude to make her happy in the
      knowledge of <i>my</i> happiness&mdash;I mean the refuge opened to me in
      this hospitable house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She twisted herself back again to the writing-table, and went on with her
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not attempted to conceal my stupidity. Let me now record a partial
      recovery of my intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be denied that Miss Jillgall had discovered a good reason
      for writing to her friend; but I was at a loss to understand why she
      should have been so anxious to mention the reason. Was it possible&mdash;after
      the talk which had passed between us&mdash;that she had something
      mischievous to say in her letter, relating to my father or to me? Was she
      afraid I might suspect this? And had she been so communicative for the
      purpose of leading my suspicions astray? These were vague guesses; but,
      try as I might, I could arrive at no clearer view of what was passing in
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s mind. What would I not have given to be able to look over
      her shoulder, without discovery!
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished her letter, and put the address, and closed the envelope.
      Then she turned round toward me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a foreign postage stamp, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I could look at nothing else, I was resolved to look at her envelope.
      It was only necessary to go to the study, and to apply to my father. I
      returned with the foreign stamp, and I stuck it on the envelope with my
      own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to interest <i>me</i> in the address, as I ought to have
      foreseen, if I had not been too much excited for the exercise of a little
      common sense. Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s wonderful friend was only remarkable by her
      ugly foreign name&mdash;MRS. TENBRUGGEN.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here I am, writing my history of myself, once more, by my own bedside.
      Some unexpected events have happened while I have been away. One of them
      is the absence of my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena has left home on a visit to a northern town by the seaside. She is
      staying in the house of a minister (one of papa&rsquo;s friends), and is
      occupying a position of dignity in which I should certainly lose my head.
      The minister and his wife and daughters propose to set up a Girls&rsquo; 
      Scripture Class, on the plan devised by papa; and they are at a loss, poor
      helpless people, to know how to begin. Helena has volunteered to set the
      thing going. And there she is now, advising everybody, governing
      everybody, encouraging everybody&mdash;issuing directions, finding fault,
      rewarding merit&mdash;oh, dear, let me put it all in one word, and say:
      thoroughly enjoying herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another event has happened, relating to papa. It so distressed me that I
      even forgot to think of Philip&mdash;for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traveling by railway (I suppose because I am not used to it) gives me the
      headache. When I got to our station here, I thought it would do me more
      good to walk home than to ride in the noisy omnibus. Half-way between the
      railway and the town, I met one of the doctors. He is a member of our
      congregation; and he it was who recommended papa, some time since, to give
      up his work as a minister and take a long holiday in foreign parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to have met with you,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;Your sister, I find,
      is away on a visit; and I want to speak to one of you about your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that he had been observing papa, in chapel, from what he called
      his own medical point of view. He did not conceal from me that he had
      drawn conclusions which made him feel uneasy. &ldquo;It may be anxiety,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;or it may be overwork. In either case, your father is in a state of
      nervous derangement, which is likely to lead to serious results&mdash;unless
      he takes the advice that I gave him when he last consulted me. There must
      be no more hesitation about it. Be careful not to irritate him&mdash;but
      remember that he must rest. You and your sister have some influence over
      him; he won&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor dear papa! I did see a change in him for the worse&mdash;though I had
      only been away for so short a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I put my arms round his neck, and kissed him, he turned pale, and
      then flushed up suddenly: the tears came into his eyes. Oh, it was hard to
      follow the doctor&rsquo;s advice, and not to cry, too; but I succeeded in
      controlling myself. I sat on his knee, and made him tell me all that I
      have written here about Helena. This led to our talking next of the new
      lady, who is to live with us as a member of the family. I began to feel
      less uneasy at the prospect of being introduced to this stranger, when I
      heard that she was papa&rsquo;s cousin. And when he mentioned her name, and saw
      how it amused me, his poor worn face brightened into a smile. &ldquo;Go and find
      her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and introduce yourself. I want to hear, Eunice, if you and
      my cousin are likely to get on well together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servants told me that Miss Jillgall was in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I searched here, there, and everywhere, and failed to find her. The place
      was so quiet, it looked so deliciously pure and bright, after smoky dreary
      London, that I sat down at the further end of the garden and let my mind
      take me back to Philip. What was he doing at that moment, while I was
      thinking of him? Perhaps he was in the company of other young ladies, who
      drew all his thoughts away to themselves? Or perhaps he was writing to his
      father in Ireland, and saying something kindly and prettily about me? Or
      perhaps he was looking forward, as anxiously as I do, to our meeting next
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had my plans, and I have changed my plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the railway journey, I thought I would tell papa at once of the new
      happiness which seems to have put a new life into me. It would have been
      delightful to make my confession to that first and best and dearest of
      friends; but my meeting with the doctor spoiled it all. After what he had
      said to me, I discovered a risk. If I ventured to tell papa that my heart
      was set on a young gentleman who was a stranger to him, could I be sure
      that he would receive my confession favorably? There was a chance that it
      might irritate him&mdash;and the fault would then be mine of doing what I
      had been warned to avoid. It might be safer in every way to wait till
      Philip paid his visit, and he and papa had been introduced to each other
      and charmed with each other. Could Helena herself have arrived at a wiser
      conclusion? I declare I felt proud of my own discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this enjoyable frame of mind I was disturbed by a woman&rsquo;s voice. The
      tone was a tone of distress, and the words reached my ears from the end of
      the garden: &ldquo;Please, miss, let me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shrubbery marks the limit of our little bit of pleasure-ground. On the
      other side of it there is a cottage standing on the edge of the common.
      The most good-natured woman in the world lives here. She is our laundress&mdash;married
      to a stupid young fellow named Molly, and blessed with a plump baby as
      sweet-tempered at herself. Thinking it likely that the piteous voice which
      had disturbed me might be the voice of Mrs. Molly, I was astonished to
      hear her appealing to anybody (perhaps to me?) to &ldquo;let her in.&rdquo; So I
      passed through the shrubbery, wondering whether the gate had been locked
      during my absence in London. No; it was as easy to open as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage door was not closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw our amiable laundress in the passage, on her knees, trying to open
      an inner door which seemed to be locked. She had her eye at the keyhole;
      and, once again, she called out: &ldquo;Please, miss, let me in.&rdquo; I waited to
      see if the door would be opened&mdash;nothing happened. I waited again, to
      hear if some person inside would answer&mdash;nobody spoke. But somebody,
      or something, made a sound of splashing water on the other side of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed myself, and asked what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Molly looked at me helplessly. She said: &ldquo;Miss Eunice, it&rsquo;s the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has the baby done?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Molly got on her feet, and whispered in my ear: &ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s a fine
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss, he&rsquo;s bewitched a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Jillgall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very person I had been trying to find! I asked where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laundress pointed dolefully to the locked door: &ldquo;In there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is your baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman still pointed to the door: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt, miss,
      whether it is my baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Mrs. Molly. If it isn&rsquo;t yours, whose baby can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her puzzled face made this singular reply more funny still. The splashing
      of water on the other side of the door began again. &ldquo;What is Miss Jillgall
      doing now?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washing the baby, miss. A week ago, she came in here, one morning; very
      pleasant and kind, I must own. She found me putting on the baby&rsquo;s things.
      She says: &lsquo;What a cherub!&rsquo; which I took as a compliment. She says: &lsquo;I
      shall call again to-morrow.&rsquo; She called again so early that she found the
      baby in his crib. &lsquo;You be a good soul,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and go about your work,
      and leave the child to me.&rsquo; I says: &lsquo;Yes, miss, but please to wait till
      I&rsquo;ve made him fit to be seen.&rsquo; She says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I mean to do
      myself.&rsquo; I stared; and I think any other person would have done the same
      in my place. &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing more than another I enjoy,&rsquo; she says,
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s making myself useful. Mrs. Molly, I&rsquo;ve taken a fancy to your
      boy-baby,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and I mean to make myself useful to <i>him</i>.&rsquo; If
      you will believe me, Miss Jillgall has only let me have one opportunity of
      putting my own child tidy. She was late this morning, and I got my chance,
      and had the boy on my lap, drying him&mdash;when in she burst like a blast
      of wind, and snatched the baby away from me. &lsquo;This is your nasty temper,&rsquo; 
      she says; &lsquo;I declare I&rsquo;m ashamed of you!&rsquo; And there she is, with the door
      locked against me, washing the child all over again herself. Twice I&rsquo;ve
      knocked, and asked her to let me in, and can&rsquo;t even get an answer. They do
      say there&rsquo;s luck in odd numbers; suppose I try again?&rdquo; Mrs. Molly knocked,
      and the proverb proved to be true; she got an answer from Miss Jillgall at
      last: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t be quiet and go away, you shan&rsquo;t have the baby back at
      all.&rdquo; Who could help it?&mdash;I burst out laughing. Miss Jillgall (as I
      supposed from the tone of her voice) took severe notice of this act of
      impropriety. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that laughing?&rdquo; she called out; &ldquo;give yourself a
      name.&rdquo; I gave my name. The door was instantly thrown open with a bang.
      Papa&rsquo;s cousin appeared, in a disheveled state, with splashes of soap and
      water all over her. She held the child in one arm, and she threw the other
      arm round my neck. &ldquo;Dearest Euneece, I have been longing to see you. How
      do you like Our baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the curious story of my introduction to Miss Jillgall, I ought perhaps
      to add that I have got to be friends with her already. I am the friend of
      anybody who amuses me. What will Helena say when she reads this?

      CHAPTER XIX. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When people are interested in some event that is coming, do they find the
      dull days, passed in waiting for it, days which they are not able to
      remember when they look back? This is my unfortunate case. Night after
      night, I have gone to bed without so much as opening my Journal. There was
      nothing worth writing about, nothing that I could recollect, until the
      postman came to-day. I ran downstairs, when I heard his ring at the bell,
      and stopped Maria on her way to the study. There, among papa&rsquo;s usual
      handful of letters, was a letter for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MISS EUNICE: .......
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever truly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I quote the passages in Philip&rsquo;s letter which most deeply interested me&mdash;I
      am his dear miss; and he is mine ever truly. The other part of the letter
      told me that he had been detained in London, and he lamented it. At the
      end was a delightful announcement that he was coming to me by the
      afternoon train. I ran upstairs to see how I looked in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first feeling was regret. For the thousandth time, I was obliged to
      acknowledge that I was not as pretty as Helena. But this passed off. A
      cheering reflection occurred to me. Philip would not have found, in my
      sister&rsquo;s face, what seems to have interested him in my face. Besides,
      there is my figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pity of it is that I am so ignorant about some things. If I had been
      allowed to read novels, I might (judging by what papa said against them in
      one of his sermons) have felt sure of my own attractions; I might even
      have understood what Philip really thought of me. However, my mind was
      quite unexpectedly set at ease on the subject of my figure. The manner in
      which it happened was so amusing&mdash;at least, so amusing to me&mdash;that
      I cannot resist mentioning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister and I are forbidden to read newspapers, as well as novels. But
      the teachers at the Girls&rsquo; Scripture Class are too old to be treated in
      this way. When the morning lessons were over, one of them was reading the
      newspaper to the other, in the empty schoolroom; I being in the passage
      outside, putting on my cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a report of &ldquo;an application made to the magistrates by the lady of
      his worship the Mayor.&rdquo; Hearing this, I stopped to listen. The lady of his
      worship (what a funny way of describing a man&rsquo;s wife!) is reported to be a
      little too fond of notoriety, and to like hearing the sound of her own
      voice on public occasions. But this is only my writing; I had better get
      back to the report. &ldquo;In her address to the magistrates, the Mayoress
      stated that she had seen a disgusting photograph in the shop window of a
      stationer, lately established in the town. She desired to bring this
      person within reach of the law, and to have all his copies of the
      shameless photograph destroyed. The usher of the court was thereupon sent
      to purchase the photograph.&rdquo;&mdash;On second thoughts, I prefer going back
      to my own writing again; it is so uninteresting to copy other people&rsquo;s
      writing. Two of the magistrates were doing justice. They looked at the
      photograph&mdash;and what did it represent? The famous statue called the
      Venus de&rsquo; Medici! One of the magistrates took this discovery indignantly.
      He was shocked at the gross ignorance which could call the classic ideal
      of beauty and grace a disgusting work. The other one made polite
      allowances. He thought the lady was much to be pitied; she was evidently
      the innocent victim of a neglected education. Mrs. Mayor left the court in
      a rage, telling the justices she knew where to get law. &ldquo;I shall expose
      Venus,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to the Lord Chancellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Scripture Class had broken up for the day, duty ought to have
      taken me home. Curiosity led me astray&mdash;I mean, led me to the
      stationer&rsquo;s window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I found our two teachers, absorbed in the photograph; having got to
      the shop first by a short cut. They seemed to think I had taken a liberty
      whom I joined them. &ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; they were careful to explain, &ldquo;to get a
      lesson in the ideal of beauty and grace.&rdquo; There was quite a little crowd
      of townsfolk collected before the window. Some of them giggled; and some
      of them wondered whether it was taken from the life. For my own part,
      gratitude to Venus obliges me to own that she effected a great improvement
      in the state of my mind. She encouraged me. If that stumpy little creature&mdash;with
      no waist, and oh, such uncertain legs!&mdash;represented the ideal of
      beauty and grace, I had reason indeed to be satisfied with my own figure,
      and to think it quite possible that my sweetheart&rsquo;s favorable opinion of
      me was not ill-bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was at the bedroom window when the time approached for Philip&rsquo;s arrival.
      Quite at the far end of the road, I discovered him. He was on foot; he
      walked like a king. Not that I ever saw a king, but I have my ideal. Ah,
      what a smile he gave me, when I made him look up by waving my handkerchief
      out of the window! &ldquo;Ask for papa,&rdquo; I whispered as he ascended the
      house-steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing to do was to wait, as patiently as I could, to be sent for
      downstairs. Maria came to me in a state of excitement. &ldquo;Oh, miss, what a
      handsome young gentleman, and how beautifully dressed! Is he&mdash;?&rdquo;
       Instead of finishing what she had to say, she looked at me with a sly
      smile. I looked at her with a sly smile. We were certainly a couple of
      fools. But, dear me, how happy sometimes a fool can be!
    </p>
    <p>
      My enjoyment of that delightful time was checked when I went into the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had expected to see papa&rsquo;s face made beautiful by his winning smile. He
      was not only serious; he actually seemed to be ill at ease when he looked
      at me. At the same time, I saw nothing to make me conclude that Philip had
      produced an unfavorable impression. The truth is, we were all three on our
      best behavior, and we showed it. Philip had brought with him a letter from
      Mrs. Staveley, introducing him to papa. We spoke of the Staveleys, of the
      weather, of the Cathedral&mdash;and then there seemed to be nothing more
      left to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed&mdash;what a dreadful thing silence is!&mdash;papa
      was sent for to see somebody who had called on business. He made his
      excuses in the sweetest manner, but still seriously. When he and Philip
      had shaken hands, would he leave us together? No; he waited. Poor Philip
      had no choice but to take leave of me. Papa then went out by the door that
      led into his study, and I was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can any words say how wretched I felt?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hoped so much from that first meeting&mdash;and where were my hopes
      now? A profane wish that I had never been born was finding its way into my
      mind, when the door of the room was opened softly, from the side of the
      passage. Maria, dear Maria, the best friend I have, peeped in. She
      whispered: &ldquo;Go into the garden, miss, and you will find somebody there who
      is dying to see you. Mind you let him out by the shrubbery gate.&rdquo; I
      squeezed her hand; I asked if she had tried the shrubbery gate with a
      sweetheart of her own. &ldquo;Hundreds of times, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it wrong for me to go to Philip, in the garden? Oh, there is no end to
      objections! Perhaps I did it <i>because</i> it was wrong. Perhaps I had
      been kept on my best behavior too long for human endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      How sadly disappointed he looked! And how rashly he had placed himself
      just where he could be seen from the back windows! I took his arm and led
      him to the end of the garden. There we were out of the reach of
      inquisitive eyes; and there we sat down together, under the big mulberry
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eunice, your father doesn&rsquo;t like me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were his first words. In justice to papa (and a little for my own
      sake too) I told him he was quite wrong. I said: &ldquo;Trust my father&rsquo;s
      goodness, trust his kindness, as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. His silence was sufficiently expressive; he looked at me
      fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may be wrong, but fond looks surely require an acknowledgment of some
      kind? Is a young woman guilty of boldness who only follows her impulses? I
      slipped my hand into his hand. Philip seemed to like it. We returned to
      our conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began: &ldquo;Tell me, dear, is Mr. Gracedieu always as serious as he is
      to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he takes exercise, does he ride? or does he walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa always walks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes by himself. Sometimes with me. Do you want to meet him when he
      goes out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is out with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. When he is out by himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible to tell me more plainly that I was not wanted? I did my
      best to express indignation by snatching my hand away from him. He was
      completely taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eunice! don&rsquo;t you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was as stupid and as disagreeable as I could possibly be: &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me help you,&rdquo; he said, with a patience which I had not deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that moment I had been leaning against the back of a garden chair.
      Something else now got between me and my chair. It stole round my waist&mdash;it
      held me gently&mdash;it strengthened its hold&mdash;it improved my temper&mdash;it
      made me fit to understand him. All done by what? Only an arm!
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask your father to do me the greatest of all favors&mdash;and
      there is no time to lose. Every day, I expect to get a letter which may
      recall me to Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart sank at this horrid prospect; and in some mysterious way my head
      must have felt it too. I mean that I found my head resting on his
      shoulder. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to get my opportunity of speaking to Mr. Gracedieu? I mustn&rsquo;t
      call on him again as soon as to-morrow or next day. But I might meet him,
      out walking alone, if you will tell me how to do it. A note to my hotel is
      all I want. Don&rsquo;t tremble, my sweet. If you are not present at the time,
      do you see any objection to my owning to your father that I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt his delicate consideration for me&mdash;I did indeed feel it
      gratefully. If he only spoke first, how well I should get on with papa
      afterward! The prospect before me was exquisitely encouraging. I agreed
      with Philip in everything; and I waited (how eagerly was only known to
      myself) to hear what he would say to me next. He prophesied next:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have told your father that I love you, he will expect me to tell
      him something else. Can you guess what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I had not been confused, perhaps I might have found the answer to this.
      As it was, I left him to reply to himself. He did it, in words which I
      shall remember as long as I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Eunice, when your father has heard my confession, he will suspect
      that there is another confession to follow it&mdash;he will want to know
      if you love me. My angel, will my hopes be your hopes too, when I answer
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What there was in this to make my heart beat so violently that I felt as
      if I was being stifled, is more than I can tell. He leaned so close to me,
      so tenderly, so delightfully close, that our faces nearly touched. He
      whispered: &ldquo;Say you love me, in a kiss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips touched my lips, pressed them, dwelt on them&mdash;oh, how can I
      tell of it! Some new enchantment of feeling ran deliciously through and
      through me. I forgot my own self; I only knew of one person in the world.
      He was master of my lips; he was master of my heart. When he whispered,
      &ldquo;kiss me,&rdquo; I kissed. What a moment it was! A faintness stole over me; I
      felt as if I was going to die some exquisite death; I laid myself back
      away from him&mdash;I was not able to speak. There was no need for it; my
      thoughts and his thoughts were one&mdash;he knew that I was quite
      overcome; he saw that he must leave me to recover myself alone. I pointed
      to the shrubbery gate. We took one long last look at each other for that
      day; the trees hid him; I was left by myself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      How long a time passed before my composure came back to me, I cannot
      remember now. It seemed as if I was waiting through some interval of my
      life that was a mystery to myself. I was content to wait, and feel the
      light evening air in the garden wafting happiness over me. And all this
      had come from a kiss! I can call the time to mind when I used to wonder
      why people made such a fuss about kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been indebted to Maria for my first taste of Paradise. I was
      recalled by Maria to the world that I had been accustomed to live in; the
      world that was beginning to fade away in my memory already. She had been
      sent to the garden in search of me; and she had a word of advice to offer,
      after noticing my face when I stepped out of the shadow of the tree: &ldquo;Try
      to look more like yourself, miss, before you let them see you at the
      tea-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa and Miss Jillgall were sitting together talking, when I opened the
      door. They left off when they saw me; and I supposed, quite correctly as
      it turned out, that I had been one of the subjects in their course of
      conversation. My poor father seemed to be sadly anxious and out of sorts.
      Miss Jillgall, if I had been in the humor to enjoy it, would have been
      more amusing than ever. One of her funny little eyes persisted in winking
      at me; and her heavy foot had something to say to my foot, under the
      table, which meant a great deal perhaps, but which only succeeded in
      hurting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father left us; and Miss Jillgall explained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dearest Euneece, that we have only been acquainted for a day or
      two and that I ought not perhaps to have expected you to confide in me so
      soon. Can I trust you not to betray me if I set an example of confidence?
      Ah, I see I can trust you! And, my dear, I do so enjoy telling secrets to
      a friend. Hush! Your father, your excellent father, has been talking to me
      about young Mr. Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She provokingly stopped there. I entreated her to go on. She invited me to
      sit on her knee. &ldquo;I want to whisper,&rdquo; she said. It was too ridiculous&mdash;but
      I did it. Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s whisper told me serious news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minister has some reason, Euneece, for disapproving of Mr. Dunboyne;
      but, mind this, I don&rsquo;t think he has a bad opinion of the young man
      himself. He is going to return Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s call. Oh, I do so hate
      formality; I really can&rsquo;t go on talking of <i>Mr.</i> Dunboyne. Tell me
      his Christian name. Ah, what a noble name! How I long to be useful to him!
      Tomorrow, my dear, after the one o&rsquo;clock dinner, your papa will call on
      Philip, at his hotel. I hope he won&rsquo;t be out, just at the wrong time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I resolved to prevent that unlucky accident by writing to Philip. If Miss
      Jillgall would have allowed it, I should have begun my letter at once. But
      she had more to say; and she was stronger than I was, and still kept me on
      her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all looks bright enough so far, doesn&rsquo;t it, dear sister? Will you let
      me be your second sister? I do so love you, Euneece. Thank you! thank you!
      But the gloomy side of the picture is to come next! The minister&mdash;no!
      now I am your sister I must call him papa; it makes me feel so young
      again! Well, then, papa has asked me to be your companion whenever you go
      out. &lsquo;Euneece is too young and too attractive to be walking about this
      great town (in Helena&rsquo;s absence) by herself.&rsquo; That was how he put it.
      Slyly enough, if one may say so of so good a man. And he used your sister
      (didn&rsquo;t he?) as a kind of excuse. I wish your sister was as nice as you
      are. However, the point is, why am I to be your companion? Because, dear
      child, you and your young gentleman are not to make appointments and to
      meet each other alone. Oh, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s it! Your father is quite
      willing to return Philip&rsquo;s call; he proposes (as a matter of civility to
      Mrs. Staveley) to ask Philip to dinner; but, mark my words, he doesn&rsquo;t
      mean to let Philip have you for his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jumped off her lap; it was horrible to hear her. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;<i>can</i>
      you be right about it?&rdquo; Miss Jillgall jumped up too. She has foreign ways
      of shrugging her shoulders and making signs with her hands. On this
      occasion she laid both hands on the upper part of her dress, just below
      her throat, and mysteriously shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my views are directed by my affections,&rdquo; she assured me, &ldquo;I never
      see wrong. My bosom is my strong point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She has no bosom, poor soul&mdash;but I understood what she meant. It
      failed to have any soothing effect on my feelings. I felt grieved and
      angry and puzzled, all in one. Miss Jillgall stood looking at me, with her
      hands still on the place where her bosom was supposed to be. She made my
      temper hotter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to marry Philip,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear Euneece. But please don&rsquo;t be so fierce about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my father does really object to my marriage,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;it must be
      because he dislikes Philip. There can be no other reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, dear&mdash;there can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the reason, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, my sweet girl, is one of the things that we have got to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      The post of this morning brought a letter from my sister. We were to
      expect her return by the next day&rsquo;s train. This was good news. Philip and
      I might stand in need of clever Helena&rsquo;s help, and we might be sure of
      getting it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing to Philip, I had asked him to let me hear how papa and he had
      got on at the hotel. I won&rsquo;t say how often I consulted my watch, or how
      often I looked out of the window for a man with a letter in his hand. It
      will be better to get on at once to the discouraging end of it, when the
      report of the interview reached me at last. Twice Philip had attempted to
      ask for my hand in marriage&mdash;and twice my father had &ldquo;deliberately,
      obstinately&rdquo; (Philip&rsquo;s own words) changed the subject. Even this was not
      all. As if he was determined to show that Miss Jillgall was perfectly
      right, and I perfectly wrong, papa (civil to Philip as long as he did not
      talk of Me) had asked him to dine with us, and Philip had accepted the
      invitation!
    </p>
    <p>
      What were we to think of it? What were we to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote back to my dear love (so cruelly used) to tell him that Helena was
      expected to return on the next day, and that her opinion would be of the
      greatest value to both of us. In a postscript I mentioned the hour at
      which we were going to the station to meet my sister. When I say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I
      mean Miss Jillgall as well as myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      We found him waiting for us at the railway. I am afraid he resented papa&rsquo;s
      incomprehensible resolution not to give him a hearing. He was silent and
      sullen. I could not conceal that to see this state of feeling distressed
      me. He showed how truly he deserved to be loved&mdash;he begged my pardon,
      and he became his own sweet self again directly. I am more determined to
      marry him than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train entered the station, all the carriages were full. I went
      one way, thinking I had seen Helena. Miss Jillgall went the other way,
      under the same impression. Philip was a little way behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not seeing my sister, I had just turned back, when a young man jumped out
      of a carriage, opposite Philip, and recognized and shook hands with him. I
      was just near enough to hear the stranger say, &ldquo;Look at the girl in our
      carriage.&rdquo; Philip looked. &ldquo;What a charming creature!&rdquo; he said, and then
      checked himself for fear the young lady should hear him. She had just
      handed her traveling bag and wraps to a porter, and was getting out.
      Philip politely offered his hand to help her. She looked my way. The
      charming creature of my sweetheart&rsquo;s admiration was, to my infinite
      amusement, Helena herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of my return marks an occasion which I am not likely to forget.
      Hours have passed since I came home&mdash;and my agitation still forbids
      the thought of repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sit at my desk I see Eunice in bed, sleeping peacefully, except when
      she is murmuring enjoyment in some happy dream. To what end has my sister
      been advancing blindfold, and (who knows?) dragging me with her, since
      that disastrous visit to our friends in London? Strange that there should
      be a leaven of superstition in <i>my</i> nature! Strange that I should
      feel fear of something&mdash;I hardly know what!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met somewhere (perhaps in my historical reading) with the
      expression: &ldquo;A chain of events.&rdquo; Was I at the beginning of that chain,
      when I entered the railway carriage on my journey home?
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the other passengers there was a young gentleman, accompanied by a
      lady who proved to be his sister. They were both well-bred people. The
      brother evidently admired me, and did his best to make himself agreeable.
      Time passed quickly in pleasant talk, and my vanity was flattered&mdash;and
      that was all. My fellow-travelers were going on to London. When the train
      reached our station the young lady sent her brother to buy some fruit,
      which she saw in the window of the refreshment-room. The first man whom he
      encountered on the platform was one of his friends; to whom he said
      something which I failed to hear. When I handed my traveling bag and my
      wraps to the porter, and showed myself at the carriage door, I heard the
      friend say: &ldquo;What a charming creature!&rdquo; Having nothing to conceal in a
      journal which I protect by a lock, I may own that the stranger&rsquo;s personal
      appearance struck me, and that what I felt this time was not flattered
      vanity, but gratified pride. He was young, he was remarkably handsome, he
      was a distinguished-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened in one moment. In the moment that followed, I found
      myself in Eunice&rsquo;s arms. That odious person, Miss Jillgall, insisted on
      embracing me next. And then I was conscious of an indescribable feeling of
      surprise. Eunice presented the distinguished-looking gentleman to me as a
      friend of hers&mdash;Mr. Philip Dunboyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honor of meeting your sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in London, at Mr.
      Staveley&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; He went on to speak easily and gracefully of the
      journey I had taken, and of his friend who had been my fellow-traveler;
      and he attended us to the railway omnibus before he took his leave. I
      observed that Eunice had something to say to him confidentially, before
      they parted. This was another example of my sister&rsquo;s childish character;
      she is instantly familiar with new acquaintances, if she happens to like
      them. I anticipated some amusement from hearing how she had contrived to
      establish confidential relations with a highly-cultivated man like Mr.
      Dunboyne. But, while Miss Jillgall was with us, it was just as well to
      keep within the limits of commonplace conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we got out of the omnibus I had, however, observed one undesirable
      result of my absence from home. Eunice and Miss Jillgall&mdash;the latter
      having, no doubt, finely flattered the former&mdash;appeared to have taken
      a strong liking to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two curious circumstances also caught my attention. I saw a change to,
      what I call self-assertion, in my sister&rsquo;s manner; something seemed to
      have raised her in her own estimation. Then, again, Miss Jillgall was not
      like her customary self. She had delightful moments of silence; and when
      Eunice asked how I liked Mr. Dunboyne, she listened to my reply with an
      appearance of interest in her ugly face which was quite a new revelation
      in my experience of my father&rsquo;s cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      These little discoveries (after what I had already observed at the
      railway-station) ought perhaps to have prepared me for what was to come,
      when my sister and I were alone in our room. But Eunice, whether she meant
      to do it or not, baffled my customary penetration. She looked as if she
      had plenty of news to tell me&mdash;with some obstacle in the way of doing
      it, which appeared to amuse instead of annoying her. If there is one thing
      more than another that I hate, it is being puzzled. I asked at once if
      anything remarkable had happened during Eunice&rsquo;s visit to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled mischievously. &ldquo;I have got a delicious surprise for you, my
      dear; and I do so enjoy prolonging it. Tell me, Helena, what did you
      propose we should both do when we found ourselves at home again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My memory was at fault. Eunice&rsquo;s good spirits became absolutely
      boisterous. She called out: &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; and tossed her journal into my hands,
      across the whole length of the room. &ldquo;We were to read each other&rsquo;s
      diaries,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is mine to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innocent of any suspicion of the true state of affairs, I began the
      reading of Eunice&rsquo;s journal. If I had not seen the familiar handwriting,
      nothing would have induced me to believe that a girl brought up in a pious
      household, the well-beloved daughter of a distinguished Congregational
      Minister, could have written that shameless record of passions unknown to
      young ladies in respectable English life. What to say, what to do, when I
      had closed the book, was more than I felt myself equal to decide. My
      wretched sister spared me the anxiety which I might otherwise have felt.
      It was she who first opened her lips, after the silence that had fallen on
      us while I was reading. These were literally the words that she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, why don&rsquo;t you congratulate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No argument could have persuaded me, as this persuaded me, that all
      sisterly remonstrance on my part would be completely thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Eunice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me beg you to excuse me. I am waiting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she interrupted me&mdash;and, oh, in what an impudent manner! She
      took my chin between her finger and thumb, and lifted my downcast face,
      and looked at me with an appearance of eager expectation which I was quite
      at a loss to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been away from home, too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do I see in this serious
      face some astonishing news waiting to overpower me? Have <i>you</i> found
      a sweetheart? Are <i>you</i> engaged to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I only put her hand away from me, and advised her to return to her chair.
      This perfectly harmless proceeding seemed absolutely to frighten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;surely you are not jealous of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was but one possible reply to this: I laughed at it. Is Eunice&rsquo;s
      head turned? She kissed me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you laugh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I begin to understand you again; I ought to
      have known that you are superior to jealousy. But, do tell me, would it be
      so very wonderful if other girls found something to envy in my good luck?
      Just think of it! Such a handsome man, such an agreeable man, such a
      clever man, such a rich man&mdash;and, not the least of his merits,
      by-the-by, a man who admires You. Come! if you won&rsquo;t congratulate me,
      congratulate yourself on having such a brother-in-law in prospect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head <i>was</i> turned. I drew the poor soul&rsquo;s attention
      compassionately to what I had said a moment since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, dear, for reminding you that I have not yet refused to offer
      my congratulations. I only told you I was waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting, of course, to hear what my father thinks of your wonderful good
      luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation, offered with the kindest intentions, produced another
      change in my very variable sister. I had extinguished her good spirits as
      I might have extinguished a light. She sat down by me, and sighed in the
      saddest manner. The heart must be hard indeed which can resist the
      distress of a person who is dear to us. I put my arm round her; she was
      becoming once more the Eunice whom I so dearly loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t distress yourself by speaking of it; I
      understand. Your father objects to your marrying Mr. Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly say, Helena, that papa does that. He
      only behaves very strangely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I indiscreet, dear, if I ask in what way father&rsquo;s behavior has
      surprised you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was quite willing to enlighten me. It was a simple little story which,
      to my mind, sufficiently explained the strange behavior that had puzzled
      my unfortunate sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could indeed be no doubt that my father considered Eunice far too
      childish in character, as yet, to undertake the duties of matrimony. But,
      with his customary delicacy, and dread of causing distress to others, he
      had deferred the disagreeable duty of communicating his opinion to Mr.
      Dunboyne. The adverse decision must, however, be sooner or later
      announced; and he had arranged to inflict disappointment, as tenderly as
      might be, at his own table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerately leaving Eunice in the enjoyment of any vain hopes which she
      may have founded on the event of the dinner-party, I passed the evening
      until supper-time came in the study with my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our talk was mainly devoted to the worthy people with whom I had been
      staying, and whose new schools I had helped to found. Not a word was said
      relating to my sister, or to Mr. Dunboyne. Poor father looked so sadly
      weary and ill that I ventured, after what the doctor had said to Eunice,
      to hint at the value of rest and change of scene to an overworked man. Oh,
      dear me, he frowned, and waved the subject away from him impatiently, with
      a wan, pale hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, I made an unpleasant discovery. Not having completely
      finished the unpacking of my boxes, I left Miss Jillgall and Eunice in the
      drawing-room, and went upstairs. In half an hour I returned, and found the
      room empty. What had become of them? It was a fine moonlight night; I
      stepped into the back drawing-room, and looked out of the window. There
      they were, walking arm-in-arm with their heads close together, deep in
      talk. With my knowledge of Miss Jillgall, I call this a bad sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd thought has just come to me. I wonder what might have happened, if
      I had been visiting at Mrs. Staveley&rsquo;s, instead of Eunice, and if Mr.
      Dunboyne had seen me first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absurd! if I was not too tired to do anything more, those last lines
      should be scratched out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I said so to Miss Jillgall, and I say it again here. Nothing will induce
      me to think ill of Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister is a good deal tired, and a little out of temper after the
      railway journey. This is exactly what happened to me when I went to
      London. I attribute her refusal to let me read her journal, after she had
      read mine, entirely to the disagreeable consequences of traveling by
      railway. Miss Jillgall accounted for it otherwise, in her own funny
      manner: &ldquo;My sweet child, your sister&rsquo;s diary is full of abuse of poor me.&rdquo;
       I humored the joke: &ldquo;Dearest Selina, keep a diary of your own, and fill it
      with abuse of my sister.&rdquo; This seemed to be a droll saying at the time.
      But it doesn&rsquo;t look particularly amusing, now it is written down. We had
      ginger wine at supper, to celebrate Helena&rsquo;s return. Although I only drank
      one glass, I daresay it may have got into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that may be, when the lovely moonlight tempted us into the garden,
      there was an end to our jokes. We had something to talk about which still
      dwells disagreeably on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I trust you, dearest Euneece, with my own precious secrets, shall I
      never, never, never live to repent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told my good little friend that she might depend on me, provided her
      secrets did no harm to any person whom I loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands and looked up at the moon&mdash;I can only suppose
      that her sentiments overpowered her. She said, very prettily, that her
      heart and my heart beat together in heavenly harmony. It is needless to
      add that this satisfied me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s generous confidence in my discretion was, I am afraid, not
      rewarded as it ought to have been. I found her tiresome at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke of an excellent friend (a lady), who had helped her, at the time
      when she lost her little fortune, by raising a subscription privately to
      pay the expenses of her return to England. Her friend&rsquo;s name&mdash;not
      very attractive to English ears&mdash;was Mrs. Tenbruggen; they had first
      become acquainted under interesting circumstances. Miss Jillgall happened
      to mention that my father was her only living relative; and it turned out
      that Mrs. Tenbruggen was familiar with his name, and reverenced his fame
      as a preacher. When he had generously received his poor helpless cousin
      under his own roof, Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s gratitude and sense of duty impelled
      her to write and tell Mrs. Tenbruggen how happy she was as a member of our
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me confess that I began to listen more attentively when the narrative
      reached this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drew a little picture of our domestic circle here,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall said,
      describing her letter; &ldquo;and I mentioned the mystery in which Mr. Gracedieu
      conceals the ages of you two dear girls. Mrs. Tenbruggen&mdash;shall we
      shorten her ugly name and call her Mrs. T.? Very well&mdash;Mrs. T. is a
      remarkably clever woman, and I looked for interesting results, if she
      would give her opinion of the mysterious circumstance mentioned in my
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, I was all eagerness to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she written to you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall looked at me affectionately, and took the reply out of her
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Euneece; and you shall hear her own words. Thus she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your letter, dear Selina, especially interests me by what it says about
      the <i>two</i> Miss Gracedieus. &lsquo;&mdash;Look, dear; she underlines the
      word Two. Why, I can&rsquo;t explain. Can you? Ah, I thought not. Well, let us
      get back to the letter. My accomplished friend continues in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can understand the surprise which you have felt at the strange course
      taken by their father, as a means of concealing the difference which there
      must be in the ages of these young ladies. Many years since, I happened to
      discover a romantic incident in the life of your popular preacher, which
      he has his reasons, as I suspect, for keeping strictly to himself. If I
      may venture on a bold guess, I should say that any person who could
      discover which was the oldest of the two daughters, would be also likely
      to discover the true nature of the romance in Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t
      that very remarkable, Euneece? You don&rsquo;t seem to see it&mdash;you funny
      child! Pray pay particular attention to what comes next. These are the
      closing sentences in my friend&rsquo;s letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you find anything new to tell me which relates to this interesting
      subject, direct your letter as before&mdash;provided you write within a
      week from the present time. Afterward, my letters will be received by the
      English physician whose card I inclose. You will be pleased to hear that
      my professional interests call me to London at the earliest moment that I
      can spare.&rsquo;&mdash;There, dear child, the letter comes to an end. I daresay
      you wonder what Mrs. T. means, when she alludes to her professional
      interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No: I was not wondering about anything. It hurt me to hear of a strange
      woman exercising her ingenuity in guessing at mysteries in papa&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Jillgall was too eagerly bent on setting forth the merits of her
      friend to notice this. I now heard that Mrs. T.&lsquo;s marriage had turned out
      badly, and that she had been reduced to earn her own bread. Her manner of
      doing this was something quite new to me. She went about, from one place
      to another, curing people of all sorts of painful maladies, by a way she
      had of rubbing them with her hands. In Belgium she was called a
      &ldquo;Masseuse.&rdquo; When I asked what this meant in English, I was told, &ldquo;Medical
      Rubber,&rdquo; and that the fame of Mrs. T.&lsquo;s wonderful cures had reached some
      of the medical newspapers published in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening (I must say for myself) very patiently, I was bold enough
      to own that my interest in what I had just heard was not quite so plain to
      me as I could have wished it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall looked shocked at my stupidity. She reminded me that there
      was a mystery in Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s letter and a mystery in papa&rsquo;s strange
      conduct toward Philip. &ldquo;Put two and two together, darling,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;and, one of these days, they may make four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this meant anything, it meant that the reason which made papa keep
      Helena&rsquo;s age and my age unknown to everybody but himself, was also the
      reason why he seemed to be so strangely unwilling to let me be Philip&rsquo;s
      wife. I really could not endure to take such a view of it as that, and
      begged Miss Jillgall to drop the subject. She was as kind as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, dear. But don&rsquo;t deceive yourself&mdash;the subject
      will turn up again when we least expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Only two days now, before we give our little dinner-party, and Philip
      finds his opportunity of speaking to papa. Oh, how I wish that day had
      come and gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      I try not to take gloomy views of things; but I am not quite so happy as I
      had expected to be when my dear was in the same town with me. If papa had
      encouraged him to call again, we might have had some precious time to
      ourselves. As it is, we can only meet in the different show-places in the
      town&mdash;with Helena on one side, and Miss Jillgall on the other, to
      take care of us. I do call it cruel not to let two young people love each
      other, without setting third persons to watch them. If I was Queen of
      England, I would have pretty private bowers made for lovers, in the
      summer, and nice warm little rooms to hold two, in the winter. Why not?
      What harm could come of it, I should like to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      The cathedral is the place of meeting which we find most convenient, under
      the circumstances. There are delightful nooks and corners about this
      celebrated building in which lovers can lag behind. If we had been in
      papa&rsquo;s chapel I should have hesitated to turn it to such a profane use as
      this; the cathedral doesn&rsquo;t so much matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I own that I felt my inferiority to Helena a little keenly? She
      could tell Philip so many things that I should have liked to tell him
      first. My clever sister taught him how to pronounce the name of the bishop
      who began building the cathedral; she led him over the crypt, and told him
      how old it was. He was interested in the crypt; he talked to Helena (not
      to me) of his ambition to write a work on cathedral architecture in
      England; he made a rough little sketch in his book of our famous tomb of
      some king. Helena knew the late royal personage&rsquo;s name, and Philip showed
      his sketch to her before he showed it to me. How can I blame him, when I
      stood there the picture of stupidity, trying to recollect something that I
      might tell him, if it was only the Dean&rsquo;s name? Helena might have
      whispered it to me, I think. She remembered it, not I&mdash;and mentioned
      it to Philip, of course. I kept close by him all the time, and now and
      then he gave me a look which raised my spirits. He might have given me
      something better than that&mdash;I mean a kiss&mdash;when we had left the
      cathedral, and were by ourselves for a moment in a corner of the Dean&rsquo;s
      garden. But he missed the opportunity. Perhaps he was afraid of the Dean
      himself coming that way, and happening to see us. However, I am far from
      thinking the worse of Philip. I gave his arm a little squeeze&mdash;and
      that was better than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      He and I took a walk along the bank of the river to-day; my sister and
      Miss Jillgall looking after us as usual. On our way through the town,
      Helena stopped to give an order at a shop. She asked us to wait for her.
      That best of good creatures, Miss Jillgall, whispered in my ear: &ldquo;Go on by
      yourselves, and leave me to wait for her.&rdquo; Philip interpreted this act of
      kindness in a manner which would have vexed me, if I had not understood
      that it was one of his jokes. He said to me: &ldquo;Miss Jillgall sees a chance
      of annoying your sister, and enjoys the prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, away we went together; it was just what I wanted; it gave me an
      opportunity of saying something to Philip, between ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could now beg of him, in his interests and mine, to make the best of
      himself when he came to dinner. Clever people, I told him, were people
      whom papa liked and admired. I said: &ldquo;Let him see, dear, how clever <i>you</i>
      are, and how many things you know&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t imagine what a high
      place you will have in his opinion. I hope you don&rsquo;t think I am taking too
      much on myself in telling you how to behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relieved that doubt in a manner which I despair of describing. His eyes
      rested on me with such a look of exquisite sweetness and love that I was
      obliged to hold by his arm, I trembled so with the pleasure of feeling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do sincerely believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are the most innocent girl,
      the sweetest, truest girl that ever lived. I wish I was a better man,
      Eunice; I wish I was good enough to be worthy of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To hear him speak of himself in that way jarred on me. If such words had
      fallen from any other man&rsquo;s lips, I should have been afraid that he had
      done something, or thought something, of which he had reason to feel
      ashamed. With Philip this was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eager to walk on rapidly, and to turn a corner in the path, before
      we could be seen. &ldquo;I want to be alone with you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked back. We were too late; Helena and Miss Jillgall had nearly
      overtaken us. My sister was on the point of speaking to Philip, when she
      seemed to change her mind, and only looked at him. Instead of looking at
      her in return, he kept his eyes cast down and drew figures on the pathway
      with his stick. I think Helena was out of temper; she suddenly turned my
      way. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wait for me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip took her up sharply. &ldquo;If Eunice likes seeing the river better than
      waiting in the street,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she free to do as she pleases?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena said nothing more; Philip walked on slowly by himself. Not knowing
      what to make of it, I turned to Miss Jillgall. &ldquo;Surely Philip can&rsquo;t have
      quarreled with Helena?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall answered in an odd off-hand manner: &ldquo;Not he! He is a great
      deal more likely to have quarreled with himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you ask him why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be thought of; it would have looked like prying into his
      thoughts. &ldquo;Selina!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is something odd about you to-day. What
      is the matter? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear, you will find yourself understanding me before long.&rdquo; I
      thought I saw something like pity in her face when she said that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;What makes you speak to me in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired; I&rsquo;m an old fool&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go back to the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word, she left me. I turned to look for Philip, and saw
      that my sister had joined him while I had been speaking to Miss Jillgall.
      It pleased me to find that they were talking in a friendly way when I
      joined them. A quarrel between Helena and my husband that is to be&mdash;no,
      my husband that <i>shall</i> be&mdash;would have been too distressing, too
      unnatural I might almost call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked along the backward path, and asked what had become of Miss
      Jillgall. &ldquo;Have you any objection to follow her example?&rdquo; he said to me,
      when I told him that Selina had returned to the town. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for
      the banks of this river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena, who used to like the river at other times, was as ready as Philip
      to leave it now. I fancy they had both been kindly waiting to change our
      walk, till I came to them, and they could study my wishes too. Of course I
      was ready to go where they pleased. I asked Philip if there was anything
      he would like to see, when we got into the streets again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clever Helena suggested what seemed to be a strange amusement to offer to
      Philip. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take him to the Girls&rsquo; School,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared to be a matter of perfect indifference to him; he was, what
      they call, ironical. &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. Deeply interesting! deeply
      interesting!&rdquo; He suddenly broke into the wildest good spirits, and tucked
      my hand under his arm with a gayety which it was impossible to resist.
      &ldquo;What a boy you are!&rdquo; Helena said, enjoying his delightful hilarity as I
      did.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the schoolroom we lost our gayety, all in a moment. Something
      unpleasant had evidently happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the eldest girls were sitting together in a corner, separated from
      the rest, and looking most wickedly sulky. The teachers were at the other
      end of the room, appearing to be ill at ease. And there, standing in the
      midst of them, with his face flushed and his eyes angry&mdash;there was
      papa, sadly unlike his gentle self in the days of his health and
      happiness. On former occasions, when the exercise of his authority was
      required in the school, his forbearing temper always set things right.
      When I saw him now, I thought of what the doctor had said of his health,
      on my way home from the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa advanced to us the moment we showed ourselves at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands&mdash;cordially shook hands&mdash;with Philip. It was
      delightful to see him, delightful to hear him say: &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t suppose,
      Mr. Dunboyne, that you are intruding; remain with us by all means if you
      like.&rdquo; Then he spoke to Helena and to me, still excited, still not like
      himself: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have come here, my dears, at a time when your
      presence was more urgently needed.&rdquo; He turned to the teachers. &ldquo;Tell my
      daughters what has happened; tell them why they see me here&mdash;shocked
      and distressed, I don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We now heard that the two girls in disgrace had broken the rules, and in
      such a manner as to deserve severe punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them had been discovered hiding a novel in her desk. The other had
      misbehaved herself more seriously still&mdash;she had gone to the theater.
      Instead of expressing any regret, they had actually dared to complain of
      having to learn papa&rsquo;s improved catechism. They had even accused him of
      treating them with severity, because they were poor girls brought up on
      charity. &ldquo;If we had been young ladies,&rdquo; they were audacious enough to say,
      &ldquo;more indulgence would have been shown to us; we should have been allowed
      to read stories and to see plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time I had been asking myself what papa meant, when he told us we
      could not have come to the schoolroom at a better time. His meaning now
      appeared. When he spoke to the offending girls, he pointed to Helena and
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are my daughters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will not deny that they are young
      ladies. Now listen. They shall tell you themselves whether my rules make
      any difference between them and you. Helena! Eunice! do I allow you to
      read novels? do I allow you to go to the play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;and hoped it was over. But he had not done yet. He
      turned to Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer some of the questions,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;from my Manual of Christian
      Obligation, which the girls call my catechism.&rdquo; He asked one of the
      questions: &ldquo;If you are told to do unto others as you would they should do
      unto you, and if you find a difficulty in obeying that Divine Precept,
      what does your duty require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is my belief that Helena has the materials in her for making another
      Joan of Arc. She rose, and answered without the slightest sign of
      timidity: &ldquo;My duty requires me to go to the minister, and to seek for
      advice and encouragement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if these fail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am to remember that my pastor is my friend. He claims no priestly
      authority or priestly infallibility. He is my fellow-Christian who loves
      me. He will tell me how he has himself failed; how he has struggled
      against himself; and what a blessed reward has followed his victory&mdash;a
      purified heart, a peaceful mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then papa released my sister, after she had only repeated two out of all
      the answers in Christian Obligation, which we first began to learn when we
      were children. He then addressed himself again to the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what you have just heard a part of my catechism? Has my daughter been
      excused from repeating it because she is a young lady? Where is the
      difference between the religious education which is given to my own child,
      and that given to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wretched girls still sat silent and obstinate, with their heads down.
      I tremble again as I write of what happened next. Papa fixed his eyes on
      me. He said, out loud: &ldquo;Eunice!&rdquo;&mdash;and waited for me to rise and
      answer, as my sister had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was entirely beyond my power to get on my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had (innocently, I am sure) discouraged me; I saw displeasure, I
      saw contempt in his face. There was a dead silence in the room. Everybody
      looked at me. My heart beat furiously, my hands turned cold, the questions
      and answers in Christian Obligation all left my memory together. I looked
      imploringly at papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life, he was hard on me. His eyes were as angry
      as ever; they showed me no mercy. Oh, what had come to me? what evil
      spirit possessed me? I felt resentment; horrid, undutiful resentment, at
      being treated in this cruel way. My fists clinched themselves in my lap,
      my face felt as hot as fire. Instead of asking my father to excuse me, I
      said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; He was astounded, as well he might be. I went on
      from bad to worse. I said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over me; he whispered: &ldquo;I am going to ask you something; I
      insist on your answering, Yes or No.&rdquo; He raised his voice, and drew
      himself back so that they could all see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been taught like your sister?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Has the catechism that
      has been her religious lesson, for all her life, been your religious
      lesson, for all your life, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;and I was in such a rage that I said it out loud. If
      Philip had handed me his cane, and had advised me to give the young
      hussies who were answerable for this dreadful state of things a good
      beating, I believe I should have done it. Papa turned his back on me and
      offered the girls a last chance: &ldquo;Do you feel sorry for what you have
      done? Do you ask to be forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither the one nor the other answered him. He called across the room to
      the teachers: &ldquo;Those two pupils are expelled the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the women looked horrified. The elder of the two approached him, and
      tried to plead for a milder sentence. He answered in one stern word:
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;&mdash;and left the schoolroom, without even a passing bow to
      Philip. And this, after he had cordially shaken hands with my poor dear,
      not half an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to have made affectionate allowance for his nervous miseries; I
      ought to have run after him, and begged his pardon. There must be
      something wrong, I am afraid, in girls loving anybody but their fathers.
      When Helena led the way out by another door, I ran after Philip; and I
      asked <i>him</i> to forgive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what I said; it was all confusion. The fear of having
      forfeited his fondness must, I suppose, have shaken my mind. I remember
      entreating Helena to say a kind word for me. She was so clever, she had
      behaved so well, she had deserved that Philip should listen to her. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
       I cried out to him desperately, &ldquo;what must you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what I think of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is your father who is
      in fault, Eunice&mdash;not you. Nothing could have been in worse taste
      than his management of that trumpery affair in the schoolroom; it was a
      complete mistake from beginning to end. Make your mind easy; I don&rsquo;t blame
      You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, really and truly, as fond of me as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena seemed to be hardly as much interested in this happy ending of my
      anxieties as I might have anticipated. She walked on by herself. Perhaps
      she was thinking of poor papa&rsquo;s strange outbreak of excitement, and
      grieving over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had only a little way to walk, before we passed the door of Philip&rsquo;s
      hotel. He had not yet received the expected letter from his father&mdash;the
      cruel letter which might recall him to Ireland. It was then the hour of
      delivery by our second post; he went to look at the letter-rack in the
      hall. Helena saw that I was anxious. She was as kind again as ever; she
      consented to wait with me for Philip, at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out to us with an open letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my father, at last,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and gave me the letter to read.
      It only contained these few lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, my dear boy, at the change for the worse in my
      handwriting. I am suffering for my devotion to the studious habits of a
      lifetime: my right hand is attacked by the malady called Writer&rsquo;s Cramp.
      The doctor here can do nothing. He tells me of some foreign woman,
      mentioned in his newspaper, who cures nervous derangements of all kinds by
      hand-rubbing, and who is coming to London. When you next hear from me, I
      may be in London too.&rdquo;&mdash;There the letter ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I knew who the foreign woman, mentioned in the newspaper, was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what does Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s friend matter to me? The one important thing
      is, that Philip has not been called back to Ireland. Here is a fortunate
      circumstance, which perhaps means more good luck. I may be Mrs. Philip
      Dunboyne before the year is out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They all notice at home that I am looking worn and haggard. That hideous
      old maid, Miss Jillgall, had her malicious welcome ready for me when we
      met at breakfast this morning: &ldquo;Dear Helena, what has become of your
      beauty? One would think you had left it in your room!&rdquo; Poor deluded Eunice
      showed her sisterly sympathy: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke about it, Selina: can&rsquo;t you see
      that Helena is ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I <i>have</i> been ill; ill of my own wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the recovery to my tranquillity will bring with it the recovery of my
      good looks. My fatal passion for Philip promises to be the utter
      destruction of everything that is good in me. Well! what is good in me may
      not be worth keeping. There is a fate in these things. If I am destined to
      rob Eunice of the one dear object of her love and hope&mdash;how can I
      resist? The one kind thing I can do is to keep her in ignorance of what is
      coming, by acts of affectionate deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, if she suffers, I suffer too. In the length and breadth of
      England, I doubt if there is a much more wicked young woman to be found
      than myself. Is it nothing to feel that, and to endure it as I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my word, there is no excuse for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this sheer impudence? No; it is the bent of my nature. I have a
      tendency to self-examination, accompanied by one merit&mdash;I don&rsquo;t spare
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are excuses for Eunice. She lives in a fools&rsquo; paradise; and she sees
      in her lover a radiant creature, shining in the halo thrown over him by
      her own self-delusion, Nothing of this sort is to be said for me. I see
      Philip as he is. My penetration looks into the lowest depths of his
      character&mdash;when I am not in his company. There seems to be a
      foundation of good, somewhere in his nature. He despises and hates himself
      (he has confessed it to me), when Eunice is with him&mdash;still believing
      in her false sweetheart. But how long do these better influences last? I
      have only to show myself, in my sister&rsquo;s absence, and Philip is mine body
      and soul. His vanity and his weakness take possession of him the moment he
      sees my face. He is one of those men&mdash;even in my little experience I
      have met with them&mdash;who are born to be led by women. If Eunice had
      possessed my strength of character, he would have been true to her for
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ought I not, in justice to myself, to have lifted my heart high above the
      reach of such a creature as this? Certainly I ought! I know it, I feel it.
      And yet, there is some fascination in having him which I am absolutely
      unable to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, I ask myself, has fed the new flame which is burning in me? Did it
      begin with gratified pride? I might well feel proud when I found myself
      admired by a man of his beauty, set off by such manners and such
      accomplishments as his. Or, has the growth of this masterful feeling been
      encouraged by the envy and jealousy stirred in me, when I found Eunice (my
      inferior in every respect) distinguished by the devotion of a handsome
      lover, and having a brilliant marriage in view&mdash;while I was left
      neglected, with no prospect of changing my title from Miss to Mrs.? Vain
      inquiries! My wicked heart seems to have secrets of its own, and to keep
      them a mystery to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has become of my excellent education? I don&rsquo;t care to inquire; I have
      got beyond the reach of good books and religious examples. Among my other
      blamable actions there may now be reckoned disobedience to my father. I
      have been reading novels in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I tried some of the famous English works, published at a price
      within the reach of small purses. Very well written, no doubt&mdash;but
      with one unpardonable drawback, so far as I am concerned. Our celebrated
      native authors address themselves to good people, or to penitent people
      who want to be made good; not to wicked readers like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at this conclusion, I tried another experiment. In a small
      bookseller&rsquo;s shop I discovered some cheap translations of French novels.
      Here, I found what I wanted&mdash;sympathy with sin. Here, there was
      opened to me a new world inhabited entirely by unrepentant people; the
      magnificent women diabolically beautiful; the satanic men dead to every
      sense of virtue, and alive&mdash;perhaps rather dirtily alive&mdash;to the
      splendid fascinations of crime. I know now that Love is above everything
      but itself. Love is the one law that we are bound to obey. How deep! how
      consoling! how admirably true! The novelists of England have reason indeed
      to hide their heads before the novelists of France. All that I have felt,
      and have written here, is inspired by these wonderful authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have relieved my mind, and may now return to the business of my diary&mdash;the
      record of domestic events.
    </p>
    <p>
      An overwhelming disappointment has fallen on Eunice. Our dinner-party has
      been put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of father&rsquo;s health is answerable for this change in our
      arrangements. That wretched scene at the school, complicated by my
      sister&rsquo;s undutiful behavior at the time, so seriously excited him that he
      passed a sleepless night, and kept his bedroom throughout the day.
      Eunice&rsquo;s total want of discretion added, no doubt, to his sufferings: she
      rudely intruded on him to express her regret and to ask his pardon. Having
      carried her point, she was at leisure to come to me, and to ask (how
      amazingly simple of her!) what she and Philip were to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had arranged it all so nicely,&rdquo; the poor wretch began. &ldquo;Philip was to
      have been so clever and agreeable at dinner, and was to have chosen his
      time so very discreetly, that papa would have been ready to listen to
      anything he said. Oh, we should have succeeded; I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it!
      Our only hope, Helena, is in you. What are we to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait?&rdquo; she repeated, hotly. &ldquo;Is my heart to be broken? and, what is more
      cruel still, is Philip to be disappointed? I expected something more
      sensible, my dear, from you. What possible reason can there be for
      waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reason&mdash;if I could only have mentioned it&mdash;was beyond
      dispute. I wanted time to quiet Philip&rsquo;s uneasy conscience, and to harden
      his weak mind against outbursts of violence, on Eunice&rsquo;s part, which would
      certainly exhibit themselves when she found that she had lost her lover,
      and lost him to me. In the meanwhile, I had to produce my reason for
      advising her to wait. It was easily done. I reminded her of the irritable
      condition of our father&rsquo;s nerves, and gave it as my opinion that he would
      certainly say No, if she was unwise enough to excite him on the subject of
      Philip, in his present frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      These unanswerable considerations seemed to produce the right effect on
      her. &ldquo;I suppose you know best,&rdquo; was all she said. And then she left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let her go without feeling any distrust of this act of submission on her
      part; it was such a common experience, in my life, to find my sister
      guiding herself by my advice. But experience is not always to be trusted.
      Events soon showed that I had failed to estimate Eunice&rsquo;s resources of
      obstinacy and cunning at their true value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later I heard the street door closed, and looked out of the
      window. Miss Jillgall was leaving the house; no one was with her. My
      dislike of this person led me astray once more. I ought to have suspected
      her of being bent on some mischievous errand, and to have devised some
      means of putting my suspicions to the test. I did nothing of the kind. In
      the moment when I turned my head away from the window, Miss Jillgall was a
      person forgotten&mdash;and I was a person who had made a serious mistake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The event of to-day began with the delivery of a message summoning me to
      my father&rsquo;s study. He had decided&mdash;too hastily, as I feared&mdash;that
      he was sufficiently recovered to resume his usual employments. I was
      writing to his dictation, when we were interrupted. Maria announced a
      visit from Mr. Dunboyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Philip had been content to send one of the servants of the hotel
      to make inquiry after Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s health. Why had he now called
      personally? Noticing that father seemed to be annoyed, I tried to make an
      opportunity of receiving Philip myself. &ldquo;Let me see him,&rdquo; I suggested; &ldquo;I
      can easily say you are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very unwillingly, as it was easy to see, my father declined to allow this.
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s visit pays me a compliment,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I must receive
      him.&rdquo; I made a show of leaving the room, and was called back to my chair.
      &ldquo;This is not a private interview, Helena; stay where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip came in&mdash;handsomer than ever, beautifully dressed&mdash;and
      paid his respects to my father with his customary grace. He was too
      well-bred to allow any visible signs of embarrassment to escape him. But
      when he shook hands with me, I felt a little trembling in his fingers,
      through the delicate gloves which fitted him like a second skin. Was it
      the true object of his visit to try the experiment designed by Eunice and
      himself, and deferred by the postponement of our dinner-party? Impossible
      surely that my sister could have practiced on his weakness, and persuaded
      him to return to his first love! I waited, in breathless interest, for his
      next words. They were not worth listening to. Oh, the poor commonplace
      creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, Mr. Gracedieu, to see that you are well enough to be in your
      study again,&rdquo; he said. The writing materials on the table attracted his
      attention. &ldquo;Am I one of the idle people,&rdquo; he asked, with his charming
      smile, &ldquo;who are always interrupting useful employment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to my father, and he was answered by my father. Not once had he
      addressed a word to me&mdash;no, not even when we shook hands. I was angry
      enough to force him into taking some notice of me, and to make an attempt
      to confuse him at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen my sister?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the shortest reply that he could choose. Having flung it at me, he
      still persisted in looking at my father and speaking to my father: &ldquo;Do you
      think of trying change of air, Mr. Gracedieu, when you feel strong enough
      to travel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duties keep me here,&rdquo; father answered; &ldquo;and I cannot honestly say that
      I enjoy traveling. I dislike manners and customs that are strange to me; I
      don&rsquo;t find that hotels reward me for giving up the comforts of my own
      house. How do you find the hotel here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I submit to the hotel, sir. They are sad savages in the kitchen; they put
      mushroom ketchup into their soup, and mustard and cayenne pepper into
      their salads. I am half-starved at dinner-time, but I don&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every word he said was an offense to me. With or without reason, I
      attacked him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard you acknowledge that the landlord and landlady are very
      obliging people,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask them to let you make your own
      soup and mix your own salad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered whether I should succeed in attracting his notice, after this.
      Even in these private pages, my self-esteem finds it hard to confess what
      happened. I succeeded in reminding Philip that he had his reasons for
      requesting me to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me, Miss Helena,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I ask leave to speak to
      Mr. Gracedieu in private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The right thing for me to do was, let me hope, the thing that I did. I
      rose, and waited to see if my father would interfere. He looked at Philip
      with suspicion in his face, as well as surprise. &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he said,
      coldly, &ldquo;what is the object of the interview?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Philip answered, &ldquo;when we are alone.&rdquo; This cool reply placed
      my father between two alternatives; he must either give way, or be guilty
      of an act of rudeness to a guest in his own house. The choice reserved for
      me was narrower still&mdash;I had to decide between being told to go, or
      going of my own accord. Of course, I left them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door which communicated with the next room was pulled to, but not
      closed. On the other side of it, I found Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listening!&rdquo; I said, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered back. &ldquo;You listen, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was so indignant with Philip, and so seriously interested in what was
      going on in the study, that I yielded to temptation. We both degraded
      ourselves. We both listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eunice&rsquo;s base lover spoke first. Judging by the change in his voice, he
      must have seen something in my father&rsquo;s face that daunted him. Eunice
      heard it, too. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting nervous,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll forget to say
      the right thing at the right time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gracedieu,&rdquo; Philip began, &ldquo;I wish to speak to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father interrupted him: &ldquo;We are alone now, Mr. Dunboyne. I want to know
      why you consult me in private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am anxious to consult you, sir, on a subject&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what subject? Any religious difficulty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything I can do for you in the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. If you will only allow me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am still waiting, sir, to know what it is about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s voice suddenly became an angry voice. &ldquo;Once for all, Mr.
      Gracedieu,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you let me speak? It&rsquo;s about your daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of it, Mr. Dunboyne!&rdquo; (My father was now as loud as Philip.) &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t desire to hold a private conversation with you on the subject of my
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have any personal objection to me, sir, be so good as to state it
      plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to ask me to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not very civil, Mr. Gracedieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I speak without ceremony, Mr. Dunboyne, you have yourself to thank for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip replied to this in a tone of savage irony. &ldquo;You are a minister of
      religion, and you are an old man. Two privileges&mdash;and you presume on
      them both. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew back into a corner, just in time to escape discovery in the
      character of a listener. Eunice never moved. When Philip dashed into the
      room, banging the door after him, she threw herself impulsively on his
      breast: &ldquo;Oh, Philip! Philip! what have you done? Why didn&rsquo;t you keep your
      temper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what your father said to me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; but you ought to have controlled yourself&mdash;you ought,
      indeed, for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arms were still round him. It struck me that he felt her influence.
      &ldquo;If you wish me to recover myself,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;you had better let
      me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how cruel, Philip, to leave me when I am so wretched! Why do you want
      to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me just now what I ought to do,&rdquo; he answered, still restraining
      himself. &ldquo;If I am to get the better of my temper, I must be left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything about your temper, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me to control myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Go back to Papa, and beg him to forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him damned first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If ever a stupid girl deserved such an answer as this, the girl was my
      sister. I had hitherto (with some difficulty) refrained from interfering.
      But when Eunice tried to follow Philip out of the house, I could hesitate
      no longer; I held her back. &ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you made mischief
      enough already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; she burst out, helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what I told you to do yesterday&mdash;wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could reply, or I could say anything more, the door that led to
      the landing was opened softly and slyly, and Miss Jillgall peeped in.
      Eunice instantly left me, and ran to the meddling old maid. They whispered
      to each other. Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s skinny arm encircled my sister&rsquo;s waist;
      they disappeared together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was only too glad to get rid of them both, and to take the opportunity
      of writing to Philip. I insisted on an explanation of his conduct while I
      was in the study&mdash;to be given within an hour&rsquo;s time, at a place which
      I appointed. &ldquo;You are not to attempt to justify yourself in writing,&rdquo; I
      added in conclusion. &ldquo;Let your reply merely inform me if you can keep the
      appointment. The rest, when we meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria took the letter to the hotel, with instructions to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s reply reached me without delay. It pledged him to justify himself
      as I had desired, and to keep the appointment. My own belief is that the
      event of to-day will decide his future and mine.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Indeed, I am a most unfortunate creature; everything turns out badly with
      me. My good, true friend, my dear Selina, has become the object of a
      hateful doubt in my secret mind. I am afraid she is keeping something from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking with her about my troubles, I heard for the first time that she
      had written again to Mrs. Tenbruggen. The object of her letter was to tell
      her friend of my engagement to young Mr. Dunboyne. I asked her why she had
      done this. The answer informed me that there was no knowing, in the
      present state of my affairs, how soon I might not want the help of a
      clever woman. I ought, I suppose, to have been satisfied with this. But
      there seemed to be something not fully explained yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again, after telling Selina what I heard in the study, and how
      roughly Philip had spoken to me afterward, I asked her what she thought of
      it. She made an incomprehensible reply: &ldquo;My sweet child, I mustn&rsquo;t think
      of it&mdash;I am too fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to make her explain what this meant. She began to talk
      of Philip; assuring me (which was quite needless) that she had done her
      best to fortify and encourage him, before he called on papa. When I asked
      her to help me in another way&mdash;that is to say, when I wanted to find
      out where Philip was at that moment&mdash;she had no advice to give me. I
      told her that I should not enjoy a moment&rsquo;s ease of mind until I and my
      dear one were reconciled. She only shook her head and declared that she
      was sorry for me. When I hit on the idea of ringing for Maria, this little
      woman, so bright, and quick and eager to help me at other times, said &ldquo;I
      leave it to you, dear,&rdquo; and turned to the piano (close to which I was
      sitting), and played softly and badly stupid little tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria, did you open the door for Mr. Dunboyne when he went away just
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing but ill-luck for me! If I had been left to my own devices, I
      should now have let the housemaid go. But Selina contrived to give me a
      hint, on a strange plan of her own. Still at the piano, she began to
      confuse talking to herself with playing to herself. The notes went <i>tinkle,
      tinkle</i>&mdash;and the tongue mixed up words with the notes in this way:
      &ldquo;Perhaps they have been talking in the kitchen about Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was not lost on me. I said to Maria&mdash;who was standing
      at the other end of the room, near the door&mdash;&ldquo;Did you happen to hear
      which way Mr. Dunboyne went when he left us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where he was, miss, half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Selina went on with her hints in the same way as before. &ldquo;How does she
      know&mdash;ah, how does she know?&rdquo; was the vocal part of the performance
      this time. My clever inquiries followed the vocal part as before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that Mr. Dunboyne was at the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sent there with a letter for him, and waited for the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no suggestion required this time. The one possible question was:
      &ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria replied, after first reserving a condition: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell upon me,
      miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised not to tell. Selina suddenly left off playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;who sent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Selina looked round at me. Her little eyes seemed to have suddenly become
      big, they stared me so strangely in the face. I don&rsquo;t know whether she was
      in a state of fright or of wonder. As for myself, I simply lost the use of
      my tongue. Maria, having no more questions to answer, discreetly left us
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should Helena write to Philip at all&mdash;and especially without
      mentioning it to me? Here was a riddle which was more than I could guess.
      I asked Selina to help me. She might at least have tried, I thought; but
      she looked uneasy, and made excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Suppose I go to Helena, and ask her why she wrote to Philip?&rdquo; And
      Selina said: &ldquo;Suppose you do, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rang for Maria once more: &ldquo;Do you know where my sister is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just gone out, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it but to wait till she came back, and to get
      through the time in the interval as I best might. But for one
      circumstance, I might not have known what to do. The truth is, there was a
      feeling of shame in me when I remembered having listened at the study
      door. Curious notions come into one&rsquo;s head&mdash;one doesn&rsquo;t know how or
      why. It struck me that I might make a kind of atonement for having been
      mean enough to listen, if I went to papa, and offered to keep him company
      in his solitude. If we fell into pleasant talk, I had a sly idea of my own&mdash;I
      meant to put in a good word for poor Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I confided my design to Selina, she shut up the piano and ran across
      the room to me. But somehow she was not like her old self again, yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You good little soul, you are always right. Look at me again, Euneece.
      Are you beginning to doubt me? Oh, my darling, don&rsquo;t do that! It isn&rsquo;t
      using me fairly. I can&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand; I was on the point of speaking to her with the kindness
      she deserved from me. On a sudden she snatched her hand away and ran back
      to the piano. When she was seated on the music-stool, her face was hidden
      from me. At that moment she broke into a strange cry&mdash;it began like a
      laugh, and it ended like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away to papa! Don&rsquo;t mind me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a creature of impulse&mdash;ha!
      ha! ha! a little hysterical&mdash;the state of the weather&mdash;I get rid
      of these weaknesses, my dear, by singing to myself. I have a favorite
      song: &lsquo;My heart is light, my will is free.&rsquo;&mdash;Go away! oh, for God&rsquo;s
      sake, go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had heard of hysterics, of course; knowing nothing about them, however,
      by my own experience. What could have happened to agitate her in this
      extraordinary manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Helena&rsquo;s letter anything to do with it? Was my sister indignant with
      Philip for swearing in my presence; and had she written him an angry
      letter, in her zeal on my behalf? But Selina could not possibly have seen
      the letter&mdash;and Helena (who is often hard on me when I do stupid
      things) showed little indulgence for me, when I was so unfortunate as to
      irritate Philip. I gave up the hopeless attempt to get at the truth by
      guessing, and went away to forget my troubles, if I could, in my father&rsquo;s
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      After knocking twice at the door of the study, and receiving no reply, I
      ventured to look in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sofa in this room stood opposite the door. Papa was resting on it, but
      not in comfort. There were twitching movements in his feet, and he shifted
      his arms this way and that as if no restful posture could he found for
      them. But what frightened me was this. His eyes, staring straight at the
      door by which I had gone in, had an inquiring expression, as if he
      actually did not know me! I stood midway between the door and the sofa,
      doubtful about going nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; This to me&mdash;to his own daughter. He said: &ldquo;What
      do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I really could <i>not</i> bear it. I went up to him. I said: &ldquo;Papa, have
      you forgotten Eunice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My name seemed (if one may say such a thing) to bring him to himself
      again. He sat upon the sofa&mdash;and laughed as he answered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, what delusion has got into that pretty little head of
      yours? Fancy her thinking that I had forgotten my own daughter! I was lost
      in thought, Eunice. For the moment, I was what they call an absent man.
      Did I ever tell you the story of the absent man? He went to call upon some
      acquaintance of his; and when the servant said, &lsquo;What name, sir?&rsquo; He
      couldn&rsquo;t answer. He was obliged to confess that he had forgotten his own
      name. The servant said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very strange.&rsquo; The absent man at once
      recovered himself. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;my name is Strange.&rsquo; Droll,
      isn&rsquo;t it? If I had been calling on a friend to-day, I daresay <i>I</i>
      might have forgotten my name, too. Much to think of, Eunice&mdash;too much
      to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the sofa with a sigh, as if he was tired of it, he began walking
      up and down. He seemed to be still in good spirits. &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here, papa to see if there was anything I could do for You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at some sheets of paper, strung together, and laid on the table.
      They were covered with writing (from his dictation) in my sister&rsquo;s hand.
      &ldquo;I ought to get on with my work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him that she had gone out, and begged leave to try what I could do
      to supply her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The request seemed to please him; but he wanted time to think. I waited;
      noticing that his face grew gradually worried and anxious. There came a
      vacant look into his eyes which it grieved me to see; he appeared to have
      quite lost himself again. &ldquo;Read the last page,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the
      manuscript on the table; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember where I left off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to the last page. As well as I could tell, it related to some
      publication, which he was recommending to religious persons of our way of
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had read half-way through it, he began to dictate, speaking so
      rapidly that my pen was not always able to follow him. My handwriting is
      as bad as bad can be when I am hurried. To make matters worse still, I was
      confused. What he was now saying seemed to have nothing to do with what I
      had been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me try if I can call to mind the substance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began in the most strangely sudden way by asking: &ldquo;Why should there be
      any fear of discovery, when every possible care had been taken to prevent
      it? The danger from unexpected events was far more disquieting. A man
      might find himself bound in honor to disclose what it had been the chief
      anxiety of his life to conceal. For example, could he let an innocent
      person be the victim of deliberate suppression of the truth&mdash;no
      matter how justifiable that suppression might appear to be? On the other
      hand, dreadful consequences might follow an honorable confession. There
      might be a cruel sacrifice of tender affection; there might be a shocking
      betrayal of innocent hope and trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember those last words, just as he dictated them, because he suddenly
      stopped there; looking, poor dear, distressed and confused. He put his
      hand to his head, and went back to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait for me while I rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he fell asleep. It was a deep repose that came to him
      now; and, though I don&rsquo;t think it lasted much longer than half an hour, it
      produced a wonderful change in him for the better when he woke. He spoke
      quietly and kindly; and when he returned to me at the table and looked at
      the page on which I had been writing, he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, what bad writing! I declare I can&rsquo;t read what I myself told
      you to write. No! no! don&rsquo;t be downhearted about it. You are not used to
      writing from dictation; and I daresay I have been too quick for you.&rdquo; He
      kissed me and encouraged me. &ldquo;You know how fond I am of my little girl,&rdquo;
       he said; &ldquo;I am afraid I like my Eunice just the least in the world more
      than I like my Helena. Ah, you are beginning to look a little happier
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had filled me with such confidence and such pleasure that I could not
      help thinking of my sweetheart. Oh dear, when shall I learn to be
      distrustful of my own feelings? The temptation to say a good word for
      Philip quite mastered any little discretion that I possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said to papa: &ldquo;If you knew how to make me happier than I have ever been
      in all my life before, would you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send for Philip, dear, and be a little kinder to him, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pale face turned red with anger; he pushed me away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man again!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Am I never to hear the last of him? Go
      away, Eunice. You are of no use here.&rdquo; He took up my unfortunate page of
      writing and ridiculed it with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;What is this fit for?&rdquo; He
      crumpled it up in his hand and tossed it into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran out of the room in such a state of mortification that I hardly knew
      what I was about. If some hard-hearted person had come to me with a cup of
      poison, and had said: &ldquo;Eunice, you are not fit to live any longer; take
      this,&rdquo; I do believe I should have taken it. If I thought of anything, I
      thought of going back to Selina. My ill luck still pursued me; she had
      disappeared. I looked about in a helpless way, completely at a loss what
      to do next&mdash;so stupefied, I may even say, that it was some time
      before I noticed a little three-cornered note on the table by which I was
      standing. The note was addressed to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EVER-DEAREST EUNEECE&mdash;I have tried to make myself useful to you, and
      have failed. But how can I see the sad sight of your wretchedness, and not
      feel the impulse to try again? I have gone to the hotel to find Philip,
      and to bring him back to you a penitent and faithful man. Wait for me, and
      hope for great things. A. hundred thousand kisses to my sweet Euneece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S. J.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wait for her, after reading that note! How could she expect it? I had only
      to follow her, and to find Philip. In another minute, I was on my way to
      the hotel.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking at the last entry in my Journal, I see myself anticipating that
      the event of to-day will decide Philip&rsquo;s future and mine. This has proved
      prophetic. All further concealment is now at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forced to it by fate, or helped to it by chance, Eunice has made the
      discovery of her lover&rsquo;s infidelity. &ldquo;In all human probability&rdquo; (as my
      father says in his sermons), we two sisters are enemies for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not suspected, as Eunice is, of making appointments with a
      sweetheart. So I am free to go out alone, and to go where I please. Philip
      and I were punctual to our appointment this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our place of meeting was in a secluded corner of the town park. We found a
      rustic seat in our retirement, set up (one would suppose) as a concession
      to the taste of visitors who are fond of solitude. The view in front of us
      was bounded by the park wall and railings, and our seat was prettily
      approached on one side by a plantation of young trees. No entrance gate
      was near; no carriage road crossed the grass. A more safe and more
      solitary nook for conversation, between two persons desiring to be alone,
      it would be hard to find in most public parks. Lovers are said to know it
      well, and to be especially fond of it toward evening. We were there in
      broad daylight, and we had the seat to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      My memory of what passed between us is, in some degree, disturbed by the
      formidable interruption which brought our talk to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But among other things, I remember that I showed him no mercy at the
      outset. At one time I was indignant; at another I was scornful. I
      declared, in regard to my object in meeting him, that I had changed my
      mind, And had decided to shorten a disagreeable interview by waiving my
      right to an explanation, and bidding him farewell. Eunice, as I pointed
      out, had the first claim to him; Eunice was much more likely to suit him,
      as a companion for life, than I was. &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; I said, in conclusion,
      &ldquo;my inclination for once takes sides with my duty, and leaves my sister in
      undisturbed possession of young Mr. Dunboyne.&rdquo; With this satirical
      explanation, I rose to say good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had merely intended to irritate him. He showed a superiority to anger
      for which I was not prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so kind as to sit down again,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my letter from his pocket, and pointed to that part of it which
      alluded to his conduct, when we had met in my father&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have offered me the opportunity of saying a word in my own defense,&rdquo;
       he went on. &ldquo;I prize that privilege far too highly to consent to your
      withdrawing it, merely because you have changed your mind. Let me at least
      tell you what my errand was, when I called on your father. Loving you, and
      you only, I had forced myself to make a last effort to be true to your
      sister. Remember that, Helena, and then say&mdash;is it wonderful if I was
      beside myself, when I found You in the study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you tell me you were beside yourself,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you mean, ashamed
      of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That touched him. &ldquo;I mean nothing of the kind,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;After the
      hell on earth in which I have been living between you two sisters, a man
      hasn&rsquo;t virtue enough left in him to be ashamed. He&rsquo;s half mad&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what he is. Look at my position! I had made up my mind never to see you
      again; I had made up my mind (if I married Eunice) to rid myself of my own
      miserable life when I could endure it no longer. In that state of feeling,
      when my sense of duty depended on my speaking with Mr. Gracedieu alone,
      whose was the first face I saw when I entered the room? If I had dared to
      look at you, or to speak to you, what do you think would have become of my
      resolution to sacrifice myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of it now?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first if I am forgiven,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;and you shall know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deserve to be forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been discovered by wiser heads than mine that weak people are
      always in extremes. So far, I had seen Philip in the vain and violent
      extreme. He now shifted suddenly to the sad and submissive extreme. When I
      asked him if he deserved to be forgiven, he made the humblest of all
      replies&mdash;he sighed and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did my duty to my sister,&rdquo; I reminded him, &ldquo;I should refuse to
      forgive you, and send you back to Eunice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s language and your father&rsquo;s conduct,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;have
      released me from that entanglement. I can never go back to Eunice. If you
      refuse to forgive me, neither you nor she will see anything more of Philip
      Dunboyne; I promise you that. Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After holding out against him resolutely, I felt myself beginning to
      yield. When a man has once taken their fancy, what helplessly weak
      creatures women are! I saw through his vacillating weakness&mdash;and yet
      I trusted him, with both eyes open. My looking-glass is opposite to me
      while I write. It shows me a contemptible Helena. I lied, and said I was
      satisfied&mdash;to please <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I forgiven?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is absurd to put it on record. Of course, I forgave him. What a good
      Christian I am, after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my willing hand. &ldquo;My lovely darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our marriage rests
      with you. Whether your father approves of it or not, say the word; claim
      me, and I am yours for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must have been infatuated by his voice and his look; my heart must have
      been burning under the pressure of his hand on mine. Was it my modesty or
      my self-control that deserted me? I let him take me in his arms. Again,
      and again, and again I kissed him. We were deaf to what we ought to have
      heard; we were blind to what we ought to have seen. Before we were
      conscious of a movement among the trees, we were discovered. My sister
      flew at me like a wild animal. Her furious hands fastened themselves on my
      throat. Philip started to his feet. When he touched her, in the act of
      forcing her back from me, Eunice&rsquo;s raging strength became utter weakness
      in an instant. Her arms fell helpless at her sides&mdash;her head drooped&mdash;she
      looked at him in silence which was dreadful, at such a moment as that. He
      shrank from the unendurable reproach in those tearless eyes. Meanly, he
      turned away from her. Meanly, I followed him. Looking back for an instant,
      I saw her step forward; perhaps to stop him, perhaps to speak to him. The
      effort was too much for her strength; she staggered back against the trunk
      of a tree. Like strangers, walking separate one from the other, we left
      her to her companion&mdash;the hideous traitress who was my enemy and her
      friend.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On reaching the street which led to Philip&rsquo;s hotel, we spoke to each other
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave this place,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To leave us (for a while), after what had happened, might be the wisest
      thing which a man, in Philip&rsquo;s critical position, could do. But if I went
      with him&mdash;unprovided as I was with any friend of my own sex, whose
      character and presence might sanction the step I had taken&mdash;I should
      be lost beyond redemption. Is any man that ever lived worth that
      sacrifice? I thought of my father&rsquo;s house closed to me, and of our friends
      ashamed of me. I have owned, in some earlier part of my Journal, that I am
      not very patient under domestic cares. But the possibility of Eunice being
      appointed housekeeper, with my power, in my place, was more than I could
      calmly contemplate. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said to Philip. &ldquo;Your absence, at such a time
      as this, may help us both; but, come what may of it, I must remain at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded, without an attempt to make me alter my mind. There was a
      sullen submission in his manner which it was not pleasant to see. Was he
      despairing already of himself and of me? Had Eunice aroused the watchful
      demons of shame and remorse?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My anxiety put the all-important question to him without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it good-by forever, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His reply instantly relieved me: &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I wanted more: &ldquo;You still love me?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More dearly than ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned pale. &ldquo;I leave you because I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid to face Eunice again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only possible way out of our difficulty that I could see, now occurred
      to me. &ldquo;Suppose my sister can be prevailed on to give you up?&rdquo; I
      suggested. &ldquo;Would you come back to us in that case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would ask my father to consent to our marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day of my return, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose obstacles get in our way,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;suppose time passes and
      tries your patience&mdash;will you still consider yourself engaged to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged to you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in spite of obstacles and in spite of
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while you are away from me,&rdquo; I ventured to add, &ldquo;we shall write to
      each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go where I may,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall always hear from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could ask no more, and he could concede no more. The impression
      evidently left on him by Eunice&rsquo;s terrible outbreak, was far more serious
      than I had anticipated. I was myself depressed and ill at ease. No
      expressions of tenderness were exchanged between us. There was something
      horrible in our barren farewell. We merely clasped hands, at parting. He
      went his way&mdash;and I went mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some occasions when women set an example of courage to men. I
      was ready to endure whatever might happen to me, when I got home. What a
      desperate wretch! some people might say, if they could look into this
      diary!
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria opened the door; she told me that my sister had already returned,
      accompanied by Miss Jillgall. There had been apparently some difference of
      opinion between them, before they entered the house. Eunice had attempted
      to go on to some other place; and Miss Jillgall had remonstrated. Maria
      had heard her say: &ldquo;No, you would degrade yourself&rdquo;&mdash;and, with that,
      she had led Eunice indoors. I understood, of course, that my sister had
      been prevented from following Philip to the hotel. There was probably a
      serious quarrel in store for me. I went straight to the bedroom, expecting
      to find Eunice there, and prepared to brave the storm that might burst on
      me. There was a woman at Eunice&rsquo;s end of the room, removing dresses from
      the wardrobe. I could only see her back, but it was impossible to mistake
      <i>that</i> figure&mdash;Miss Jillgall. She laid the dresses on Eunice&rsquo;s
      bed, without taking the slightest notice of me. In significant silence I
      pointed to the door. She went on as coolly with her occupation as if the
      room had been, not mine but hers; I stepped up to her, and spoke plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oblige me to remind you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you are not in your own
      room.&rdquo; There, I waited a little, and found that I had produced no effect.
      &ldquo;With every disposition,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;to make allowance for the
      disagreeable peculiarities of your character, I cannot consent to overlook
      an act of intrusion, committed by a Spy. Now, do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round her. &ldquo;I see no third person here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;May I ask
      if you mean me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so good, Miss Helena, as to explain yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moderation of language would have been thrown away on this woman. &ldquo;You
      followed me to the park,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was you who found me with Mr.
      Dunboyne, and betrayed me to my sister. You are a Spy, and you know it. At
      this very moment you daren&rsquo;t look me in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her insolence forced its way out of her at last. Let me record it&mdash;and
      repay it, when the time comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;If I ventured to look you in the face, I am
      afraid I might forget myself. I have always been brought up like a lady,
      and I wish to show it even in the company of such a wretch as you are.
      There is not one word of truth in what you have said of me. I went to the
      hotel to find Mr. Dunboyne. Ah, you may sneer! I haven&rsquo;t got your good
      looks&mdash;and a vile use you have made of them. My object was to recall
      that base young man to his duty to my dear charming injured Euneece. The
      hotel servant told me that Mr. Dunboyne had gone out. Oh, I had the means
      of persuasion in my pocket! The man directed me to the park, as he had
      already directed Mr. Dunboyne. It was only when I had found the place,
      that I heard some one behind me. Poor innocent Euneece had followed me to
      the hotel, and had got her directions, as I had got mine. God knows how
      hard I tried to persuade her to go back, and how horribly frightened I was&mdash;No!
      I won&rsquo;t distress myself by saying a word more. It would be too humiliating
      to let <i>you</i> see an honest woman in tears. Your sister has a spirit
      of her own, thank God! She won&rsquo;t inhabit the same room with you; she never
      desires to see your false face again. I take the poor soul&rsquo;s dresses and
      things away&mdash;and as a religious person I wait, confidently wait, for
      the judgment that will fall on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught up the dresses all together; some of them were in her arms,
      some of them fell on her shoulders, and one of them towered over her head.
      Smothered in gowns, she bounced out of the room like a walking milliner&rsquo;s
      shop. I have to thank the wretched old creature for a moment of genuine
      amusement, at a time of devouring anxiety. The meanest insect, they say,
      has its use in this world&mdash;and why not Miss Jillgall?
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour more, an unexpected event raised my spirits. I heard from
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to the hotel he had found a telegram waiting for him. Mr.
      Dunboyne the elder had arrived in London; and Philip had arranged to join
      his father by the next train. He sent me the address, and begged that I
      would write and tell him my news from home by the next day&rsquo;s post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome, thrice welcome, to Mr. Dunboyne the elder! If Philip can manage,
      under my advice, to place me favorably in the estimation of this rich old
      man, his presence and authority may do for us what we cannot do for
      ourselves. Here is surely an influence to which my father must submit, no
      matter how unreasonable or how angry he may be when he hears what has
      happened. I begin already to feel hopeful of the future.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the day, and through the night, I feel a misery that never leaves
      me&mdash;I mean the misery of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am trying to find out some harmless means of employing myself, which
      will keep evil remembrances from me. If I don&rsquo;t succeed, my fear tells me
      what will happen. I shall be in danger of going mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare not confide in any living creature. I don&rsquo;t know what other persons
      might think of me, or how soon I might find myself perhaps in an asylum.
      In this helpless condition, doubt and fright seem to be driving me back to
      my Journal. I wonder whether I shall find harmless employment here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard of old people losing their memories. What would I not give to
      be old! I remember! oh, how I remember! One day after another I see
      Philip, I see Helena, as I first saw them when I was among the trees in
      the park. My sweetheart&rsquo;s arms, that once held me, hold my sister now. She
      kisses him, kisses him, kisses him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there no way of making myself see something else? I want to get back to
      remembrances that don&rsquo;t burn in my head and tear at my heart. How is it to
      be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried books&mdash;no! I have tried going out to look at the shops&mdash;no!
      I have tried saying my prayers&mdash;no! And now I am making my last
      effort; trying my pen. My black letters fall from it, and take their
      places on the white paper. Will my black letters help me? Where can I find
      something consoling to write down? Where? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina&mdash;poor Selina, so fond of me, so sorry for me. When I was
      happy, she was happy, too. It was always amusing to hear her talk. Oh, my
      memory, be good to me! Save me from Philip and Helena. I want to remember
      the pleasant days when my kind little friend and I used to gossip in the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      No: the days in the garden won&rsquo;t come back. What else can I think of?
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollections that I try to encourage keep away from me. The other
      recollections that I dread, come crowding back. Still Philip! Still
      Helena!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Selina mixes herself up with them. Let me try again if I can think of
      Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      How delightfully good to me and patient with me she was, on our dismal way
      home from the park! And how affectionately she excused herself for not
      having warned me of it, when she first suspected that my own sister and my
      worst enemy were one and the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I was wrong, my dear, to let my love and pity close my lips. But
      remember how happy you were at the time. The thought of making you
      miserable was more than I could endure&mdash;I am so fond of you! Yes; I
      began to suspect them, on the day when they first met at the station. And,
      I am afraid, I thought it just likely that you might be as cunning as I
      was, and have noticed them, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how ignorant she must have been of my true thoughts and feelings! How
      strangely people seem to misunderstand their dearest friends! knowing, as
      I did, that I could never love any man but Philip, could I be wicked
      enough to suppose that Philip would love any woman but me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained to Selina how he had spoken to me, when we were walking
      together on the bank of the river. Shall I ever forget those exquisite
      words? &ldquo;I wish I was a better man, Eunice; I wish I was good enough to be
      worthy of you.&rdquo; I asked Selina if she thought he was deceiving me when he
      said that. She comforted me by owning that he must have been in earnest,
      at the time&mdash;and then she distressed me by giving the reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love, you must have innocently said something to him, when you and he
      were alone, which touched his conscience (when he <i>had</i> a
      conscience), and made him ashamed of himself. Ah, you were too fond of him
      to see how he changed for the worse, when your vile sister joined you, and
      took possession of him again. It made my heart ache to see you so
      unsuspicious of them. You asked me, my poor dear, if they had quarreled&mdash;you
      believed they were tired of walking by the river, when it was you they
      were tired of&mdash;and you wondered why Helena took him to see the
      school. My child! she was the leading spirit at the school, and you were
      nobody. Her vanity saw the chance of making him compare you at a
      disadvantage with your clever sister. I declare, Euneece, I lose my head
      if I only think of it! All the strong points in my character seem to slip
      away from me. Would you believe it?&mdash;I have neglected that sweet
      infant at the cottage; I have even let Mrs. Molly have her baby back
      again. If I had the making of the laws, Philip Dunboyne and Helena
      Gracedieu should be hanged together on the same gallows. I see I shock
      you. Don&rsquo;t let us talk of it! Oh, don&rsquo;t let us talk of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here am I writing of it! What I had determined not to do, is what I
      have done. Am I losing my senses already? The very names that I was most
      anxious to keep out of my memory stare me in the face in the lines that I
      have just written. Philip again! Helena again!
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, and something new that must and will be remembered, shrink
      from it as I may. This afternoon, I met Helena on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and eyed me with a wicked smile; she held out her hand. &ldquo;We
      are likely to meet often, while we are in the same house,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t we better consult appearances, and pretend to be as fond of each
      other as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took no notice of her hand; I took no notice of her shameless proposal.
      She tried again: &ldquo;After all, it isn&rsquo;t my fault if Philip likes me better
      than he likes you. Don&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo; I still refused to speak to her.
      She still persisted. &ldquo;How black you look, Eunice! Are you sorry you didn&rsquo;t
      kill me, when you had your hands on my throat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and left me. I was obliged to sit down on the stair&mdash;I
      trembled so. My own reply frightened me. I tried to find out why I had
      said Yes. I don&rsquo;t remember being conscious of meaning anything. It was as
      if somebody else had said Yes&mdash;not I. Perhaps I was provoked, and the
      word escaped me before I could stop it. Could I have stopped it? I don&rsquo;t
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sleepless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I pass the miserable hours in writing letters to Philip and then
      tearing them up? Or did I only fancy that I wrote to him? I have just
      looked at the fireplace. The torn paper in it tells me that I did write.
      Why did I destroy my letters? I might have sent one of them to Philip.
      After what has happened? Oh, no! no!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been many days away from the Girls&rsquo; Scripture Class, it seemed to
      be possible that going back to the school and the teaching might help me
      to escape from myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing succeeds with me. I found it impossible to instruct the girls as
      usual; their stupidity soon reached the limit of my patience&mdash;suffocated
      me with rage. One of them, a poor, fat, feeble creature, began to cry when
      I scolded her. I looked with envy at the tears rolling over her big round
      cheeks. If I could only cry, I might perhaps bear my hard fate with
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked toward home by a roundabout way; feeling as if want of sleep was
      killing me by inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the High Street, I saw Helena; she was posting a letter, and was not
      aware that I was near her. Leaving the post-office, she crossed the
      street, and narrowly escaped being run over. Suppose the threatened
      accident had really taken place&mdash;how should I have felt, if it had
      ended fatally? What a fool I am to be putting questions to myself about
      things that have not happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      The walking tired me; I went straight home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could ring the bell, the house door opened, and the doctor came
      out. He stopped to speak to me. While I had been away (he said), something
      had happened at home (he neither knew nor wished to know what) which had
      thrown my father into a state of violent agitation. The doctor had
      administered composing medicine. &ldquo;My patient is asleep now,&rdquo; he told me;
      &ldquo;but remember what I said to you the last time we met; a longer rest than
      any doctor&rsquo;s prescription can give him is what he wants. You are not
      looking well yourself, my dear. What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him of my wretched restless nights; and asked if I might take some
      of the composing medicine which he had given to my father. He forbade me
      to touch a drop of it. &ldquo;What is physic for your father, you foolish child,
      is not physic for a young creature like you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Count a thousand,
      if you can&rsquo;t sleep to-night, or turn your pillow. I wish you pleasant
      dreams.&rdquo; He went away, amused at his own humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Selina waiting to speak with me, on the subject of poor papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been startled on hearing his voice, loud in anger. In the fear
      that something serious had happened, she left her room to make inquiries,
      and saw Helena on the landing of the flight of stairs beneath, leaving the
      study. After waiting till my sister was out of the way, Selina ventured to
      present herself at the study door, and to ask if she could be of any use.
      My father, walking excitedly up and down the room, declared that both his
      daughters had behaved infamously, and that he would not suffer them to
      speak to him again until they had come to their senses, on the subject of
      Mr. Dunboyne. He would enter into no further explanation; and he had
      ordered, rather than requested, Selina to leave him. Having obeyed, she
      tried next to find me, and had just looked into the dining-room to see if
      I was there, when she was frightened by the sound of a fall in the room
      above&mdash;that is to say, in the study. Running upstairs again, she had
      found him insensible on the floor and had sent for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mind this,&rdquo; Selina continued, &ldquo;the person who has done the mischief
      is the person whom I saw leaving the study. What your unnatural sister
      said to provoke her father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your unnatural sister will tell you herself,&rdquo; Helena&rsquo;s voice added.
      She had opened the door while we were too much absorbed in our talk to
      hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selina attempted to leave the room. I caught her by the hand, and held her
      back. I was afraid of what I might do if she left me by myself. Never have
      I felt anything like the rage that tortured me, when I saw Helena looking
      at us with the same wicked smile on her lips that had insulted me when we
      met on the stairs. &ldquo;Have <i>we</i> anything to be ashamed of?&rdquo; I said to
      Selina. &ldquo;Stay where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be of some use, Miss Jillgall, if you stay,&rdquo; my sister suggested.
      &ldquo;Eunice seems to be trembling. Is she angry, or is she ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sting of this was in the tone of her voice. It was the hardest thing I
      ever had to do in my life&mdash;but I did succeed in controlling myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with what you have to say,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t notice me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not very polite, my dear, but I can make allowances. Oh, come!
      come! putting up your hands to stop your ears is too childish. You would
      do better to express regret for having misled your father. Yes! you did
      mislead him. Only a few days since, you left him to suppose that you were
      engaged to Philip. It became my duty, after that, to open his eyes to the
      truth; and if I unhappily provoked him, it was your fault. I was strictly
      careful in the language I used. I said: &lsquo;Dear father, you have been
      misinformed on a very serious subject. The only marriage engagement for
      which your kind sanction is requested, is <i>my</i> engagement. <i>I</i>
      have consented to become Mrs. Philip Dunboyne.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I to stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have something to say. You and I are looking at each other.
      Does my face tell you what is passing in my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your face seems to be paler than usual,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;that is not all. The devil that possessed me, when I
      discovered you with Philip, is not cast out of me yet. Silence the
      sneering devil that is in You, or we may both live to regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether I did or did not frighten her, I cannot say. This only I know&mdash;she
      turned away silently to the door, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped on the sofa. That horrid hungering for revenge, which I felt for
      the first time when I knew how Helena had wronged me, began to degrade and
      tempt me again. In the effort to get away from this new evil self of mine,
      I tried to find sympathy in Selina, and called to her to come and sit by
      me. She seemed to be startled when I looked at her, but she recovered
      herself, and came to me, and took my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could comfort you!&rdquo; she said, in her kind simple way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep my hand in your hand,&rdquo; I told her; &ldquo;I am drowning in dark water&mdash;and
      I have nothing to hold by but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling, don&rsquo;t talk in that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Selina! dear Selina! You shall talk to me. Say something harmless&mdash;tell
      me a melancholy story&mdash;try to make me cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My poor little friend looked sadly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more likely to cry myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is so heart-breaking&mdash;I
      almost wish I was back in the time, before you came home, the time when
      your detestable sister first showed how she hated me. I was happy, meanly
      happy, in the spiteful enjoyment of provoking her. Oh, Euneece, I shall
      never recover my spirits again! All the pity in the world would not be
      pity enough for <i>you</i>. So hardly treated! so young! so forlorn! Your
      good father too ill to help you; your poor mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted her; she had interested me in something better than my own
      wretched self. I asked directly if she had known my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I never even saw her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my father never spoken to you about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only once, when I asked him how long she had been dead. He told me you
      lost her while you were an infant, and he told me no more. I was looking
      at her portrait in the study, only yesterday. I think it must be a bad
      portrait; your mother&rsquo;s face disappoints me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had arrived at the same conclusion years since. But I shrank from
      confessing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; Selina continued, &ldquo;you are not like her. Nobody would ever
      guess that you were the child of that lady, with the long slanting
      forehead and the restless look in her eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Selina had said of me and my mother&rsquo;s portrait, other friends had
      said. There was nothing that I know of to interest me in hearing it
      repeated&mdash;and yet it set me pondering on the want of resemblance
      between my mother&rsquo;s face and mine, and wondering (not for the first time)
      what sort of woman my mother was. When my father speaks of her, no words
      of praise that he can utter seem to be good enough for her. Oh, me, I wish
      I was a little more like my mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to get dark; Maria brought in the lamp. The sudden brightness of
      the flame struck my aching eyes, as if it had been a blow from a knife. I
      was obliged to hide my face in my handkerchief. Compassionate Selina
      entreated me to go to bed. &ldquo;Rest your poor eyes, my child, and your weary
      head&mdash;and try at least to get some sleep.&rdquo; She found me very docile;
      I kissed her, and said good-night. I had my own idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was quiet in the house, I stole out into the passage and listened
      at the door of my father&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard his regular breathing, and opened the door and went in. The
      composing medicine, of which I was in search, was not on the table by his
      bedside. I found it in the cupboard&mdash;perhaps placed purposely out of
      his reach. They say that some physic is poison, if you take too much of
      it. The label on the bottle told me what the dose was. I dropped it into
      the medicine glass, and swallowed it, and went back to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very gently, so as not to wake him, I touched poor papa&rsquo;s forehead with my
      lips. &ldquo;I must have some of your medicine,&rdquo; I whispered to him; &ldquo;I want it,
      dear, as badly as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I returned to my own room&mdash;and lay down in bed, waiting to be
      composed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. EUNICE&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      My restless nights are passed in Selina&rsquo;s room.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Her bed remains near the window. My bed has been placed opposite, near the
      door. Our night-light is hidden in a corner, so that the faint glow of it
      is all that we see. What trifles these are to write about! But they mix
      themselves up with what I am determined to set down in my Journal, and
      then to close the book for good and all. I had not disturbed my little
      friend&rsquo;s enviable repose, either when I left our bed-chamber, or when I
      returned to it. The night was quiet, and the stars were out. Nothing moved
      but the throbbing at my temples. The lights and shadows in our
      half-darkened room, which at other times suggest strange resemblances to
      my fancy, failed to disturb me now. I was in a darkness of my own making,
      having bound a handkerchief, cooled with water, over my hot eyes. There
      was nothing to interfere with the soothing influence of the dose that I
      had taken, if my father&rsquo;s medicine would only help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began badly. The clock in the hall struck the quarter past the hour, the
      half-past, the three-quarters past, the new hour. Time was awake&mdash;and
      I was awake with Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a trial to my patience that I thought of going back to my
      father&rsquo;s room, and taking a second dose of the medicine, no matter what
      the risk might be. On attempting to get up, I became aware of a change in
      me. There was a dull sensation in my limbs which seemed to bind them down
      on the bed. It was the strangest feeling. My will said, Get up&mdash;and
      my heavy limbs said, No.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay quite still, thinking desperate thoughts, and getting nearer and
      nearer to the end that I had been dreading for so many days past. Having
      been as well educated as most girls, my lessons in history had made me
      acquainted with assassination and murder. Horrors which I had recoiled
      from reading in past happy days, now returned to my memory; and, this
      time, they interested instead of revolting me. I counted the three first
      ways of killing as I happened to remember them, in my books of
      instruction:&mdash;a way by stabbing; a way by poison; a way in a bed, by
      suffocation with a pillow. On that dreadful night, I never once called to
      mind what I find myself remembering now&mdash;the harmless past time, when
      our friends used to say: &ldquo;Eunice is a good girl; we are all fond of
      Eunice.&rdquo; Shall I ever be the same lovable creature again?
    </p>
    <p>
      While I lay thinking, a strange thing happened. Philip, who had haunted me
      for days and nights together, vanished out of my thoughts. My memory of
      the love which had begun so brightly, and had ended so miserably, became a
      blank. Nothing was left but my own horrid visions of vengeance and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while, the strokes of the clock still reached my ears. But it was an
      effort to count them; I ended in letting them pass unheeded. Soon
      afterward, the round of my thoughts began to circle slowly and more
      slowly. The strokes of the clock died out. The round of my thoughts
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, my eyes were still covered by the handkerchief which I had
      laid over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness began to weigh on my spirits, and to fill me with distrust. I
      found myself suspecting that there was some change&mdash;perhaps an
      unearthly change&mdash;passing over the room. To remain blindfolded any
      longer was more than I could endure. I lifted my hand&mdash;without being
      conscious of the heavy sensation which, some time before, had laid my
      limbs helpless on the bed&mdash;I lifted my hand, and drew the
      handkerchief away from my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint glow of the night-light was extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the room was not quite dark. There was a ghastly light trembling over
      it; like nothing that I have ever seen by day; like nothing that I have
      ever seen by night. I dimly discerned Selina&rsquo;s bed, and the frame of the
      window, and the curtains on either side of it&mdash;but not the starlight,
      and not the shadowy tops of the trees in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light grew fainter and fainter; the objects in the room faded slowly
      away. Darkness came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be a saying hard to believe&mdash;but, when I declare that I was
      not frightened, I am telling the truth. Whether the room was lighted by
      awful light, or sunk in awful dark, I was equally interested in the
      expectation of what might happen next. I listened calmly for what I might
      hear: I waited calmly for what I might feel. A touch came first. I feel it
      creeping on my face&mdash;like a little fluttering breeze. The sensation
      pleased me for a while. Soon it grew colder, and colder, and colder, till
      it froze me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no more!&rdquo; I cried out. &ldquo;You are killing me with an icy death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dead-cold touches lingered a moment longer&mdash;and left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sound came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sound of a whisper on my pillow, close to my ear. My strange
      insensibility to fear remained undisturbed. The whisper was welcome, it
      kept me company in the dark room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It said to me: &ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It said: &ldquo;Who have you been thinking of this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered: &ldquo;My mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whisper said: &ldquo;I am your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, command the light to come back! Show yourself to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My face was hidden when I passed from life to death. My face no mortal
      creature may see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, touch me! Kiss me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My touch is poison. My kiss is death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sense of fear began to come to me now. I moved my head away on the
      pillow. The whisper followed my movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You are an Evil Spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whisper answered: &ldquo;I am your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come to tempt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to harden your heart. Daughter of mine, whose blood is cool;
      daughter of mine, who tamely submits&mdash;you have loved. Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man you loved has deserted you. Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman has lured him away to herself. A woman has had no mercy on you,
      or on him. Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she lives, what crime toward you will she commit next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she lives, she will marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let her live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I hardened your heart against her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kill her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden silence. I was still left in the darkness; feeling
      nothing, hearing nothing. Even the consciousness that I was lying on my
      bed deserted me. I had no idea that I was in the bedroom; I had no
      knowledge of where I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghastly light that I had seen already dawned on me once more. I was no
      longer in my bed, no longer in my room, no longer in the house. Without
      wonder, without even a feeling of surprise, I looked round. The place was
      familiar to me. I was alone in the Museum of our town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light flowed along in front of me. I followed, from room to room in
      the Museum, where the light led.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, through the picture-gallery, hung with the works of modern masters;
      then, through the room filled with specimens of stuffed animals. The lion
      and the tiger, the vulture of the Alps and the great albatross, looked
      like living creatures threatening me, in the supernatural light. I entered
      the third room, devoted to the exhibition of ancient armor, and the
      weapons of all nations. Here the light rose higher, and, leaving me in
      darkness where I stood, showed a collection of swords, daggers, and knives
      arranged on the wall in imitation of the form of a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whisper sounded again, close at my ear. It echoed my own thought, when
      I called to mind the ways of killing which history had taught me. It said:
      &ldquo;Kill her with the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No. My heart failed me when I thought of the blood. I hid the dreadful
      weapons from my view. I cried out: &ldquo;Let me go! let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, I was lost in darkness. Again, I had no knowledge in me of where I
      was. Again, after an interval, the light showed me the new place in which
      I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was alone in the burial-ground of our parish church. The light led me
      on, among the graves, to the lonely corner in which the great yew tree
      stands; and, rising higher, revealed the solemn foliage, brightened by the
      fatal red fruit which hides in itself the seeds of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whisper tempted me again. It followed again the train of my own
      thought. It said: &ldquo;Kill her by poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No. Revenge by poison steals its way to its end. The base deceitfulness of
      Helena&rsquo;s crime against me seemed to call for a day of reckoning that hid
      itself under no disguise. I raised my cry to be delivered from the sight
      of the deadly tree. The changes which I have tried to describe followed
      once more the confession of what I felt; the darkness was dispelled for
      the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing in Helena&rsquo;s room, looking at her as she lay asleep in her
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite still now; but she must have been restless at some earlier
      time. The bedclothes were disordered, her head had sunk so low that the
      pillow rose high and vacant above her. There, colored by a tender flush of
      sleep, was the face whose beauty put my poor face to shame. There, was the
      sister who had committed the worst of murders&mdash;the wretch who had
      killed in me all that made life worth having. While that thought was in my
      mind, I heard the whisper again. &ldquo;Kill her openly,&rdquo; the tempter mother
      said. &ldquo;Kill her daringly. Faint heart, do you still want courage? Rouse
      your spirit; look! see yourself in the act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The temptation took a form which now tried me for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if a mirror had reflected the scene, I saw myself standing by the
      bedside, with the pillow that was to smother the sleeper in my hands. I
      heard the whispering voice telling me how to speak the words that warned
      and condemned her: &ldquo;Wake! you who have taken him from me! Wake! and meet
      your doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw her start up in bed. The sudden movement disordered the nightdress
      over her bosom and showed the miniature portrait of a man, hung round her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was Philip. The likeness was looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So dear, so lovely&mdash;those eyes that had once been the light of my
      heart, mourned for me and judged me now. They saw the guilty thought that
      polluted me; they brought me to my knees, imploring him to help me back to
      my better self: &ldquo;One last mercy, dear, to comfort me under the loss of
      you. Let the love that was once my life, be my good angel still. Save me,
      Philip, even though you forsake me&mdash;save me from myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agony of it pierced my brain&mdash;drove away the ghastly light&mdash;silenced
      the tempting whispers. I came to myself. I saw&mdash;and not in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena <i>had</i> started up in her bed. That cry of terror, at the sight
      of me in her room at night, <i>had</i> burst from her lips. The miniature
      of Philip hung round her neck, a visible reality. Though my head was
      dizzy, though my heart was sinking, I had not lost my senses yet. All that
      the night lamp could show me, I still saw; and I heard the sound, faintly,
      when the door of the bed-chamber was opened. Alarmed by that piercing cry,
      my father came hurrying into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word passed between us three. The whispers that I had heard were
      wicked; the thoughts that had been in my mind were vile. Had they left
      some poison in the air of the room, which killed the words on our lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      My father looked at Helena. With a trembling hand she pointed to me. He
      put his arm round me and held me up. I remember his leading me away&mdash;and
      I remember nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My last words are written. I lock up this journal of misery-never, I hope
      and pray, to open it again. &mdash;&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE MIDDLE-AGED LADY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the year 1870 I found myself compelled to submit to the demands of two
      hard task-masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing age and failing health reminded the Governor of the Prison of
      his duty to his successor, in one unanswerable word&mdash;Resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they have employed us and interested us, for the greater part of our
      lives, we bid farewell to our duties&mdash;even to the gloomy duties of a
      prison&mdash;with a sense of regret. My view of the future presented a
      vacant prospect indeed, when I looked at my idle life to come, and
      wondered what I should do with it. Loose on the world&mdash;at my age!&mdash;I
      drifted into domestic refuge, under the care of my two dear and good sons.
      After a while (never mind how long a while) I began to grow restless under
      the heavy burden of idleness. Having nothing else to complain of, I
      complained of my health, and consulted a doctor. That sagacious man hit on
      the right way of getting rid of me&mdash;he recommended traveling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unexpected advice. After some hesitation, I accepted it
      reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instincts of age recoil from making new acquaintances, contemplating
      new places, and adopting new habits. Besides, I hate railway traveling.
      However, I contrived to get as far as Italy, and stopped to rest at
      Florence. Here, I found pictures by the old masters that I could really
      enjoy, a public park that I could honestly admire, and an excellent friend
      and colleague of former days; once chaplain to the prison, now clergyman
      in charge of the English Church. We met in the gallery of the Pitti
      Palace; and he recognized me immediately. I was pleased to find that the
      lapse of years had made so little difference in my personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveler who advances as far as Florence, and does not go on to Rome,
      must be regardless indeed of the opinions of his friends. Let me not
      attempt to conceal it&mdash;I am that insensible traveler. Over and over
      again, I said to myself: &ldquo;Rome must be done&rdquo;; and over and over again I
      put off doing it. To own the truth, the fascinations of Florence, aided by
      the society of my friend, laid so strong a hold on me that I believe I
      should have ended my days in the delightful Italian city, but for the
      dangerous illness of one of my sons. This misfortune hurried me back to
      England, in dread, every step of the way, of finding that I had arrived
      too late. The journey (thank God!) proved to have been taken without need.
      My son was no longer in danger, when I reached London in the year 1875.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that date I was near enough to the customary limit of human life to
      feel the necessity of rest and quiet. In other words, my days of travel
      had come to their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having established myself in my own country, I did not forget to let old
      friends know where they might find me. Among those to whom I wrote was
      another colleague of past years, who still held his medical appointment in
      the prison. When I received the doctor&rsquo;s reply, it inclosed a letter
      directed to me at my old quarters in the Governor&rsquo;s rooms. Who could
      possibly have sent a letter to an address which I had left five years
      since? My correspondent proved to be no less a person than the
      Congregational Minister&mdash;the friend whom I had estranged from me by
      the tone in which I had written to him, on the long-past occasion of his
      wife&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a distressing letter to read. I beg permission to give only the
      substance of it in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entreating me, with touching expressions of humility and sorrow, to
      forgive his long silence, the writer appealed to my friendly remembrance
      of him. He was in sore need of counsel, under serious difficulties; and I
      was the only person to whom he could apply for help. In the disordered
      state of his health at that time, he ventured to hope that I would visit
      him at his present place of abode, and would let him have the happiness of
      seeing me as speedily as possible. He concluded with this extraordinary
      postscript:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you see my daughters, say nothing to either of them which relates,
      in any way, to the subject of their ages. You shall hear why when we
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reading of this letter naturally reminded me of the claims which my
      friend&rsquo;s noble conduct had established on my admiration and respect, at
      the past time when we met in the prison. I could not hesitate to grant his
      request&mdash;strangely as it was expressed, and doubtful as the prospect
      appeared to be of my answering the expectations which he had founded on
      the renewal of our intercourse. Answering his letter by telegraph, I
      promised to be with him on the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the station, I found that I was the only traveler, by a
      first-class carriage, who left the train. A young lady, remarkable by her
      good looks and good dressing, seemed to have noticed this trifling
      circumstance. She approached me with a ready smile. &ldquo;I believe I am
      speaking to my father&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my name is Helena Gracedieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was one of the Minister&rsquo;s two &ldquo;daughters&rdquo;; and that one of the two&mdash;as
      I discovered the moment I shook hands with her&mdash;who was my friend&rsquo;s
      own child. Miss Helena recalled to me her mother&rsquo;s face, infinitely
      improved by youth and health, and by a natural beauty which that cruel and
      deceitful woman could never have possessed. The slanting forehead and the
      shifting, flashing eyes, that I recollected in the parent, were reproduced
      (slightly reproduced, I ought to say) in the child. As for the other
      features, I had never seen a more beautiful nose and mouth, or a more
      delicately-shaped outline, than was presented by the lower part of the
      face. But Miss Helena somehow failed to charm me. I doubt if I should have
      fallen in love with her, even in the days when I was a foolish young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first question that I put, as we drove from the station to the house,
      related naturally to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very ill,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;I am afraid you must prepare yourself to see
      a sad change. Nerves. The mischief first showed itself, the doctor tells
      us, in derangement of his nervous system. He has been, I regret to tell
      you, obstinate in refusing to give up his preaching and pastoral work. He
      ought to have tried rest at the seaside. Things have gone on from bad to
      worse. Last Sunday, at the beginning of his sermon, he broke down. Very,
      very sad, is it not? The doctor says that precious time has been lost, and
      he must make up his mind to resign his charge. He won&rsquo;t hear of it. You
      are his old friend. Please try to persuade him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fluently spoken; the words well chosen; the melodious voice reminding me
      of the late Mrs. Gracedieu&rsquo;s advantages in that respect; little sighs
      judiciously thrown in here and there, just at the right places;
      everything, let me own, that could present a dutiful daughter as a pattern
      of propriety&mdash;and nothing, let me add, that could produce an
      impression on my insensible temperament. If I had not been too discreet to
      rush at a hasty conclusion, I might have been inclined to say: her
      mother&rsquo;s child, every inch of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest which I was still able to feel in my friend&rsquo;s domestic
      affairs centered in the daughter whom he had adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her infancy I had seen the child, and liked her; I was the one person
      living (since the death of Mrs. Gracedieu) who knew how the Minister had
      concealed the sad secret of her parentage; and I wanted to discover if the
      hereditary taint had begun to show itself in the innocent offspring of the
      murderess. Just as I was considering how I might harmlessly speak of Miss
      Helena&rsquo;s &ldquo;sister,&rdquo; Miss Helena herself introduced the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;if you were disappointed when you found nobody
      but me to meet you at our station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was an opportunity of paying her a compliment, if I had been a
      younger man, or if she had produced a favorable impression on me. As it
      was, I hit&mdash;if I may praise myself&mdash;on an ingenious compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What excuse could I have,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;for feeling disappointed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hear you are an official personage&mdash;I ought to say, perhaps,
      a retired official personage. We might have received you more
      respectfully, if <i>both</i> my father&rsquo;s daughters had been present at the
      station. It&rsquo;s not my fault that my sister was not with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she said this strengthened my prejudice against her. It
      told me that the two girls were living together on no very friendly terms;
      and it suggested&mdash;justly or unjustly I could not then decide&mdash;that
      Miss Helena was to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is away from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Miss Helena, that is a good reason for her not coming to meet
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;it is a bad reason. She has been sent away for
      the recovery of her health&mdash;and the loss of her health is entirely
      her own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did this matter to me? I decided on dropping the subject. My memory
      reverted, however, to past occasions on which the loss of <i>my</i> health
      had been entirely my own fault. There was something in these personal
      recollections, which encouraged my perverse tendency to sympathize with a
      young lady to whom I had not yet been introduced. The young lady&rsquo;s sister
      appeared to be discouraged by my silence. She said: &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t
      think the worse of me for what I have just mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will fail to see any need of my speaking of my sister at all?
      Will you kindly listen, if I try to explain myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slyly set the best construction on my perfectly commonplace reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The fact is, my father (I can&rsquo;t imagine why)
      wishes you to see my sister as well as me. He has written to the farmhouse
      at which she is now staying, to tell her to come home to-morrow. It is
      possible&mdash;if your kindness offers me an opportunity&mdash;that I may
      ask to be guided by your experience, in a little matter which interests
      me. My sister is rash, and reckless, and has a terrible temper. I should
      be very sorry indeed if you were induced to form an unfavorable opinion of
      me, from anything you might notice if you see us together. You understand
      me, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To set me against her sister, in her own private interests&mdash;there, as
      I felt sure, was the motive under which she was acting. As hard as her
      mother, as selfish as her mother, and, judging from those two bad
      qualities, probably as cruel as her mother. That was how I understood Miss
      Helena Gracedieu, when our carriage drew up at her father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged lady was on the doorstep, when we arrived, just ringing the
      bell. She looked round at us both; being evidently as complete a stranger
      to my fair companion as she was to me. When the servant opened the door,
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Jillgall at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that odd name, Miss Helena tossed her head disdainfully.
      She took no sort of notice of the stranger-lady who was at the door of her
      father&rsquo;s house. This young person&rsquo;s contempt for Miss Jillgall appeared to
      extend to Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the servant&rsquo;s answer was: &ldquo;Not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The middle aged lady said: &ldquo;Do you expect her back soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call again, later in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady stole another look at me, before she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the name,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and walked away.

      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE MINISTER&rsquo;S MISFORTUNE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Do you know that lady?&rdquo; Miss Helena asked, as we entered the house.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a perfect stranger to me,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you have not forgotten her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think I have forgotten her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she evidently remembered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady had no doubt looked at me twice. If this meant that my face was
      familiar to her, I could only repeat what I have already said. Never, to
      my knowledge, had I seen her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading the way upstairs, Miss Helena apologized for taking me into her
      father&rsquo;s bedroom. &ldquo;He is able to sit up in an armchair,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and he
      might do more, as I think, if he would exert himself. He won&rsquo;t exert
      himself. Very sad. Would you like to look at your room, before you see my
      father? It is quite ready for you. We hope&rdquo;&mdash;she favored me with a
      fascinating smile, devoted to winning my heart when her interests required
      it&mdash;&ldquo;we hope you will pay us a long visit; we look on you as one of
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her, and said I would shake hands with my old friend before I
      went to my room. We parted at the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is out of my power to describe the shock that overpowered me when I
      first saw the Minister again, after the long interval of time that had
      separated us. Nothing that his daughter said, nothing that I myself
      anticipated, had prepared me for that lamentable change. For the moment, I
      was not sufficiently master of myself to be able to speak to him. He added
      to my embarrassment by the humility of his manner, and the formal
      elaboration of his apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel painfully that I have taken a liberty with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after
      the long estrangement between us&mdash;for which my want of Christian
      forbearance is to blame. Forgive it, sir, and forget it. I hope to show
      that necessity justifies my presumption, in subjecting you to a wearisome
      journey for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beginning to recover myself, I begged that he would make no more excuses.
      My interruption seemed to confuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that you are the one man who can
      understand me. There is my only reason for asking to see you, and looking
      forward as I do to your advice. You remember the night&mdash;or was it the
      day?&mdash;before that miserable woman was hanged? You were the only
      person present when I agreed to adopt the poor little creature, stained
      already (one may say) by its mother&rsquo;s infamy. I think your wisdom foresaw
      what a terrible responsibility I was undertaking; you tried to prevent it.
      Well! well! you have been in my confidence&mdash;you only. Mind! nobody in
      this house knows that one of the two girls is not really my daughter. Pray
      stop me, if you find me wandering from the point. My wish is to show that
      you are the only man I can open my heart to. She&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, as if
      in search of a lost idea, and left the sentence uncompleted. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      went on, &ldquo;I was thinking of my adopted child. Did I ever tell you that I
      baptized her myself? and by a good Scripture name too&mdash;Eunice. Ah,
      sir, that little helpless baby is a grown-up girl now; of an age to
      inspire love, and to feel love. I blush to acknowledge it; I have behaved
      with a want of self-control, with a cowardly weakness.&mdash;No! I am,
      indeed, wandering this time. I ought to have told you first that I have
      been brought face to face with the possibility of Eunice&rsquo;s marriage. And,
      to make it worse still, I can&rsquo;t help liking the young man. He comes of a
      good family&mdash;excellent manners, highly educated, plenty of money, a
      gentleman in every sense of the word. And poor little Eunice is so fond of
      him! Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful to be obliged to check her dearly-loved Philip? The
      young gentleman&rsquo;s name is Philip. Do you like the name? I say I am obliged
      to cheek her sweetheart in the rudest manner, when all he wants to do is
      to ask me modestly for my sweet Eunice&rsquo;s hand. Oh, what have I not
      suffered, without a word of sympathy to comfort me, before I had courage
      enough to write to you! Shall I make a dreadful confession? If my
      religious convictions had not stood in my way, I believe I should have
      committed suicide. Put yourself in my place. Try to see yourself shrinking
      from a necessary explanation, when the happiness of a harmless girl&mdash;so
      dutiful, so affectionate&mdash;depended on a word of kindness from your
      lips. And that word you are afraid to speak! Don&rsquo;t take offense, sir; I
      mean myself, not you. Why don&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo; he burst out fiercely,
      incapable of perceiving that he had allowed me no opportunity of speaking
      to him. &ldquo;Good God! don&rsquo;t you understand me, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The signs of mental confusion in his talk had so distressed me, that I had
      not been composed enough to feel sure of what he really meant, until he
      described himself as &ldquo;shrinking from a necessary explanation.&rdquo; Hearing
      those words, my knowledge of the circumstances helped me; I realized what
      his situation really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I understand you at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had suddenly become distrustful. &ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; he muttered, with a
      furtive look at me. &ldquo;I want to be satisfied that you understand my
      position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your position,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You are placed between two
      deplorable alternatives. If you tell this young gentleman that Miss
      Eunice&rsquo;s mother was a criminal hanged for murder, his family&mdash;even if
      he himself doesn&rsquo;t recoil from it&mdash;will unquestionably forbid the
      marriage; and your adopted daughter&rsquo;s happiness will be the sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Frightfully true! Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, on the other hand, you sanction the marriage, and conceal the truth,
      you commit a deliberate act of deceit; and you leave the lives of the
      young couple at the mercy of a possible discovery, which might part
      husband and wife&mdash;cast a slur on their children&mdash;and break up
      the household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered while he listened to me. &ldquo;Come to the end of it,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no more to say, and I was obliged to answer him to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more to say?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You have not told me yet what I most want
      to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did a rash thing; I asked what it was that he most wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see it for yourself?&rdquo; he demanded indignantly. &ldquo;Suppose you
      were put between those two alternatives which you mentioned just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do, sir, in my place? Would you own the disgraceful truth&mdash;before
      the marriage&mdash;or run the risk, and keep the horrid story to
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either way, my reply might lead to serious consequences. I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threatened me with his poor feeble hand. It was only the anger of a
      moment; his humor changed to supplication. He reminded me piteously of
      bygone days: &ldquo;You used to be a kind-hearted man. Has age hardened you?
      Have you no pity left for your old friend? My poor heart is sadly in want
      of a word of wisdom, spoken kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who could have resisted this? I took his hand: &ldquo;Be at ease, dear Minister.
      In your place I should run the risk, and keep that horrid story to
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back gently in his chair. &ldquo;Oh, the relief of it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How
      can I thank you as I ought for quieting my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized the opportunity of quieting his mind to good purpose by
      suggesting a change of subject. &ldquo;Let us have done with serious talk for
      the present,&rdquo; I proposed. &ldquo;I have been an idle man for the last five
      years, and I want to tell you about my travels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His attention began to wander, he evidently felt no interest in my
      travels. &ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; he asked anxiously, &ldquo;that we have said all we
      ought to say? No!&rdquo; he cried, answering his own question. &ldquo;I believe I have
      forgotten something&mdash;I am certain I have forgotten something. Perhaps
      I mentioned it in the letter I wrote to you. Have you got my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed it to him. He read the letter, and gave it back to me with a
      heavy sigh. &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; he said despairingly. &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the lost remembrance connected with anybody in the house?&rdquo; I asked,
      trying to help him. &ldquo;Does it relate, by any chance, to one of the young
      ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonderful man! Nothing escapes you. Yes; the thing I have forgotten
      concerns one of the girls. Stop! Let me get at it by myself. Surely it
      relates to Helena?&rdquo; He hesitated; his face clouded over with an expression
      of anxious thought. &ldquo;Yes; it relates to Helena,&rdquo; he repeated &ldquo;but how?&rdquo;
       His eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I am ashamed of my weakness,&rdquo; he said
      faintly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how dreadful it is to forget things in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The injury that his mind had sustained now assumed an aspect that was
      serious indeed. The subtle machinery, which stimulates the memory, by
      means of the association of ideas, appeared to have lost its working power
      in the intellect of this unhappy man. I made the first suggestion that
      occurred to me, rather than add to his distress by remaining silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we talk of your daughter,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the merest accident&mdash;a word
      spoken at random by. you or me&mdash;may be all your memory wants to rouse
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He agreed eagerly to this: &ldquo;Yes! Yes! Let me begin. Helena met you, I
      think, at the station. Of course, I remember that; it only happened a few
      hours since. Well?&rdquo; he went on, with a change in his manner to parental
      pride, which it was pleasant to see, &ldquo;did you think my daughter a fine
      girl? I hope Helena didn&rsquo;t disappoint you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite the contrary.&rdquo; Having made that necessary reply, I saw my way to
      keeping his mind occupied by a harmless subject. &ldquo;It must, however, be
      owned,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that your daughter surprised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she mentioned her name. Who could have supposed that you&mdash;an
      inveterate enemy to the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;would have christened
      your daughter by the name of a Roman Catholic Saint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened to this with a smile. Had I happily blundered on some
      association which his mind was still able to pursue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You happen to be wrong this time,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;I never gave my
      girl the name of Helena; and, what is more, I never baptized her. You
      ought to know that. Years and years ago, I wrote to tell you that my poor
      wife had made me a proud and happy father. And surely I said that the
      child was born while she was on a visit to her brother&rsquo;s rectory. Do you
      remember the name of the place? I told you it was a remote little village,
      called&mdash;Suppose we put <i>your</i> memory to a test? Can you remember
      the name?&rdquo; he asked, with a momentary appearance of triumph showing
      itself, poor fellow, in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the time that had elapsed, the name had slipped my memory. When I
      confessed this, he exulted over me, with an unalloyed pleasure which it
      was cheering to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> memory is failing you now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The name is Long Lanes.
      And what do you think my wife did&mdash;this is so characteristic of her!&mdash;when
      I presented myself at her bedside. Instead of speaking of our own baby,
      she reminded me of the name that I had given to our adopted daughter when
      I baptized the child. &lsquo;You chose the ugliest name that a girl can have,&rsquo; 
      she said. I begged her to remember that &lsquo;Eunice&rsquo; was a name in Scripture.
      She persisted in spite of me. (What firmness of character!) &lsquo;I detest the
      name of Eunice!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and now that I have a girl of my own, it&rsquo;s my
      turn to choose the name; I claim it as my right.&rsquo; She was beginning to get
      excited; I allowed her to have her own way, of course. &lsquo;Only let me know,&rsquo; 
      I said, &lsquo;what the name is to be when you have thought of it.&rsquo; My dear sir,
      she had the name ready, without thinking about it: &lsquo;My baby shall be
      called by the name that is sweetest in my ears, the name of my dear lost
      mother.&rsquo; We had&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;a slight difference of
      opinion when I heard that the name was to be Helena. I really could <i>not</i>
      reconcile it to my conscience to baptize a child of mine by the name of a
      Popish saint. My wife&rsquo;s brother set things right between us. A worthy good
      man; he died not very long ago&mdash;I forget the date. Not to detain you
      any longer, the rector of Long Lanes baptized our daughter. That is how
      she comes by her un-English name; and so it happens that her birth is
      registered in a village which her father has never inhabited. I hope, sir,
      you think a little better of my memory now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was afraid to tell him what I really did think.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not fifty years old yet; and he had just exhibited one of the sad
      symptoms which mark the broken memory of old age. Lead him back to the
      events of many years ago, and (as he had just proved to me) he could
      remember well and relate coherently. But let him attempt to recall
      circumstances which had only taken place a short time since, and
      forgetfulness and confusion presented the lamentable result, just as I
      have related it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort that he had made, the agitation that he had undergone in
      talking to me, had confirmed my fears that he would overtask his wasted
      strength. He lay back in his chair. &ldquo;Let us go on with our conversation,&rdquo;
       he murmured. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t recovered what I had forgotten, yet.&rdquo; His eyes
      closed, and opened again languidly. &ldquo;There was something I wanted to
      recall&mdash;&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and you were helping me.&rdquo; His weak voice died
      away; his weary eyes closed again. After waiting until there could be no
      doubt that he was resting peacefully in sleep, I left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. THE LIVELY OLD MAID.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A perfect stranger to the interior of the house (seeing that my experience
      began and ended with the Minister&rsquo;s bedchamber), I descended the stairs,
      in the character of a guest in search of domestic information.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way down, I heard the door of a room on the ground floor opened, and
      a woman&rsquo; s voice below, speaking in a hurry: &ldquo;My dear, I have not a moment
      to spare; my patients are waiting for me.&rdquo; This was followed by a
      confidential communication, judging by the tone. &ldquo;Mind! not a word about
      me to that old gentleman!&rdquo; Her patients were waiting for her&mdash;had I
      discovered a female doctor? And there was some old gentleman whom she was
      not willing to trust&mdash;surely I was not that much-injured man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the hall just as the lady said her last words, I caught a glimpse
      of her face, and discovered the middle-aged stranger who had called on
      &ldquo;Miss Jillgall,&rdquo; and had promised to repeat her visit. A second lady was
      at the door, with her back to me, taking leave of her friend. Having said
      good-by, she turned round&mdash;and we confronted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found her to be a little person, wiry and active; past the prime of
      life, and ugly enough to encourage prejudice, in persons who take a
      superficial view of their fellow-creatures. Looking impartially at the
      little sunken eyes which rested on me with a comical expression of
      embarrassment, I saw signs that said: There is some good here, under a
      disagreeable surface, if you can only find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saluted me with a carefully-performed curtsey, and threw open the door
      of a room on the ground floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray walk in, sir, and permit me to introduce myself. I am Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;Miss Jillgall. Proud indeed to make the
      acquaintance of a gentleman distinguished in the service of his country&mdash;or
      perhaps I ought to say, in the service of the Law. The Governor offers
      hospitality to prisoners. And who introduces prisoners to board and
      lodging with the Governor?&mdash;the Law. Beautiful weather for the time
      of year, is it not? May I ask&mdash;have you seen your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The embarrassment which I had already noticed had extended by this time to
      her voice and her manner. She was evidently trying to talk herself into a
      state of confidence. It seemed but too probable that I was indeed the
      person mentioned by her prudent friend at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having acknowledged that I had not seen my room yet, my politeness
      attempted to add that there was no hurry. The wiry little lady was of the
      contrary opinion; she jumped out of her chair as if she had been shot out
      of it. &ldquo;Pray let me make myself useful. The dream of my life is to make
      myself useful to others; and to such a man as you&mdash;I consider myself
      honored. Besides, I do enjoy running up and down stairs. This way, dear
      sir; this way to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She skipped up the stairs, and stopped on the first landing. &ldquo;Do you know,
      I am a timid person, though I may not look like it. Sometimes, curiosity
      gets the better of me&mdash;and then I grow bold. Did you notice a lady
      who was taking leave of me just now at the house door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I had seen the lady for a moment, but not for the first
      time. &ldquo;Just as I arrived here from the station,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I found her
      paying a visit when you were not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and do tell me one thing more.&rdquo; My readiness in answering
      seemed to have inspired Miss Jillgall with confidence. I heard no more
      confessions of overpowering curiosity. &ldquo;Am I right,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;in
      supposing that Miss Helena accompanied you on your way here from the
      station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say anything particular, when she saw the lady asking for me at
      the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Helena thought,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the lady recognized me as a person
      whom she had seen before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you think yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Miss Helena was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very extraordinary!&rdquo; With that remark, Miss Jillgall dropped the subject.
      The meaning of her reiterated inquiries was now, as it seemed to me, clear
      enough. She was eager to discover how I could have inspired the distrust
      of me, expressed in the caution addressed to her by her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the upper floor, she paused before the Minister&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe many years have passed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;since you last saw Mr.
      Gracedieu. I am afraid you have found him a sadly changed man? You won&rsquo;t
      be angry with me, I hope, for asking more questions? I owe Mr. Gracedieu a
      debt of gratitude which no devotion, on my part, can ever repay. You don&rsquo;t
      know what a favor I shall consider it, if you will tell me what you think
      of him. Did it seem to you that he was not quite himself? I don&rsquo;t mean in
      his looks, poor dear&mdash;I mean in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was true sorrow and sympathy in her face. I believe I should hardly
      have thought her ugly, if we had first met at that moment. Thus far, she
      had only amused me. I began really to like Miss Jillgall now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not conceal from you,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the state of Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s mind surprised and distressed me. But I ought also to tell you
      that I saw him perhaps at his worst. The subject on which he wished to
      speak with me would have agitated any man, in his state of health. He
      consulted me about his daughter&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall suddenly turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter&rsquo;s marriage?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Oh, you frighten me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I frighten you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to find some difficulty in expressing herself. &ldquo;I hardly know
      how to put it, sir. You will excuse me (won&rsquo;t you?) if I say what I feel.
      You have influence&mdash;not the sort of influence that finds places for
      people who don&rsquo;t deserve them, and gets mentioned in the newspapers&mdash;I
      only mean influence over Mr. Gracedieu. That&rsquo;s what frightens me. How do I
      know&mdash;? Oh, dear, I&rsquo;m asking another question! Allow me, for once, to
      be plain and positive. I&rsquo;m afraid, sir, you have encouraged the Minister
      to consent to Helena&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you mean Eunice&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam! Eunice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said Miss Jillgall to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard her. &ldquo;This is what I mean,&rdquo; I asserted, in my most positive
      manner. &ldquo;The only subject on which the Minister has consulted me is Miss
      Eunice&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My tone left her no alternative but to believe me. She looked not only
      bewildered, but alarmed. &ldquo;Oh, poor man, has he lost himself in such a
      dreadful way as that?&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; She
      turned to me. &ldquo;You have been talking with him for some time. Please try to
      remember. While Mr. Gracedieu was speaking of Euneece, did he say nothing
      of Helena&rsquo;s infamous conduct to her sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not the slightest hint of any such thing, I assured her, had reached my
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I can tell you what he has forgotten! We kept as much
      of that miserable story to ourselves as we could, in mercy to him.
      Besides, he was always fondest of Euneece; she would live in his memory
      when he had forgotten the other&mdash;the wretch, the traitress, the
      plotter, the fiend!&rdquo; Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s good manners slipped, as it were,
      from under her; she clinched her fists as a final means of expressing her
      sentiments. &ldquo;The wretched English language isn&rsquo;t half strong enough for
      me,&rdquo; she declared with a look of fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a liberty. &ldquo;May I ask what Miss Helena has done?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>May</i> you ask? Oh, Heavens! you must ask, you shall ask. Mr.
      Governor, if your eyes are not opened to Helena&rsquo;s true character, I can
      tell you what she will do; she will deceive you into taking her part. Do
      you think she went to the station out of regard for the great man? Pooh!
      she went with an eye to her own interests; and she means to make the great
      man useful. Thank God, I can stop that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She checked herself there, and looked suspiciously at the door of Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the interest of our conversation,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;we have not given a
      thought to the place we have been talking in. Do you think the Minister
      has heard us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if he is asleep&mdash;as I left him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall shook her head ominously. &ldquo;The safe way is this way,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE FUTURE LOOKS GLOOMY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My ever-helpful guide led me to my room&mdash;well out of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      hearing, if he happened to be awake&mdash;at the other end of the passage.
      Having opened the door, she paused on the threshold. The decrees of that
      merciless English despot, Propriety, claimed her for their own. &ldquo;Oh,
      dear!&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;ought I to go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My interest as a man (and, what is more, an old man) in the coming
      disclosure was too serious to be trifled with in this way. I took her arm,
      and led her into my room as if I was at a dinner-party, leading her to the
      table. Is it the good or the evil fortune of mortals that the comic side
      of life, and the serious side of life, are perpetually in collision with
      each other? We burst out laughing, at a moment of grave importance to us
      both. Perfectly inappropriate, and perfectly natural. But we were neither
      of us philosophers, and we were ashamed of our own merriment the moment it
      had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you hear what I have to tell you,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall began, &ldquo;I hope you
      will think as I do. What has slipped Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s memory, it may be
      safer to say&mdash;for he is sometimes irritable, poor dear&mdash;where he
      won&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she told the lamentable story of the desertion of Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence I listened, from first to last. How could I trust myself to
      speak, as I must have spoken, in the presence of a woman? The cruel injury
      inflicted on the poor girl, who had interested and touched me in the first
      innocent year of her life&mdash;who had grown to womanhood to be the
      victim of two wretches, both trusted by her, both bound to her by the
      sacred debt of love&mdash;so fired my temper that I longed to be within
      reach of the man, with a horsewhip in my hand. Seeing in my face, as I
      suppose, what was passing in my mind, Miss Jillgall expressed sympathy and
      admiration in her own quaint way: &ldquo;Ah, I like to see you so angry! It&rsquo;s
      grand to know that a man who has governed prisoners has got such a pitying
      heart. Let me tell you one thing, sir. You will be more angry than ever,
      when you see my sweet girl to-morrow. And mind this&mdash;it is Helena&rsquo;s
      devouring vanity, Helena&rsquo;s wicked jealousy of her sister&rsquo;s good fortune,
      that has done the mischief. Don&rsquo;t be too hard on Philip? I do believe, if
      the truth was told, he is ashamed of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt inclined to be harder on Philip than ever. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall started. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Governor, don&rsquo;t show the severe side of
      yourself, after the pretty compliment I have just paid to you! What a
      masterful voice! and what eyes, dear sir; what terrifying eyes! I feel as
      if I was one of your prisoners, and had misbehaved myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I repeated my question with improvement, I hope, in my looks and tones:
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me obstinate, my dear lady. I only want to know if he is in
      this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall seemed to take a curious pleasure in disappointing me; she
      had not forgotten my unfortunate abruptness of look and manner. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
      find him here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has left England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you must know, sir, he is in London&mdash;with Mr. Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more it recalled to my memory a remarkable letter, addressed
      to me many years ago, which will be found in my introductory narrative.
      The writer&mdash;an Irish gentleman, named Dunboyne confided to me that
      his marriage had associated him with the murderess, who had then been
      recently executed, as brother-in-law to that infamous woman. This
      circumstance he had naturally kept a secret from every one, including his
      son, then a boy. I alone was made an exception to the general rule,
      because I alone could tell him what had become of the poor little girl,
      who in spite of the disgraceful end of her mother was still his niece. If
      the child had not been provided for, he felt it his duty to take charge of
      her education, and to watch over her prospects in the future. Such had
      been his object in writing to me; and such was the substance of his
      letter. I had merely informed him, in reply, that his kind intentions had
      been anticipated, and that the child&rsquo;s prosperous future was assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s keen observation noticed the impression that had been
      produced upon me. &ldquo;Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s name seems to surprise you.&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first time I have heard you mention it,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked as if she could hardly believe me. &ldquo;Surely you must have heard
      the name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I told you about poor Euneece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Mr. Gracedieu must have mentioned it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This second reply in the negative irritated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she said, sharply, &ldquo;you appeared to know Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s
      name, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;the name seemed to come upon you as a surprise.
      I don&rsquo;t understand it. If I have mentioned Philip&rsquo;s name once, I have
      mentioned it a dozen times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were completely at cross-purposes. She had taken something for granted
      which was an unfathomable mystery to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;if you did mention his name a dozen times&mdash;excuse
      me for asking the question&mdash;-what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Miss Jillgall, &ldquo;do you mean to say you never guessed
      that Philip was Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son! Dunboyne&rsquo;s son! How could I have guessed it?
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later time only, the good little creature who had so innocently
      deceived me, remembered that the mischief might have been wrought by the
      force of habit. While he had still a claim on their regard the family had
      always spoken of Eunice&rsquo;s unworthy lover by his Christian name; and what
      had been familiar in their mouths felt the influence of custom, before
      time enough had elapsed to make them think as readily of the enemy as they
      had hitherto thought of the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was ignorant of this: and the disclosure by which I found myself
      suddenly confronted was more than I could support. For the moment, speech
      was beyond me.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son! Dunboyne&rsquo;s son!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a position that young man had occupied, unsuspected by his father,
      unknown to himself! kept in ignorance of the family disgrace, he had been
      a guest in the house of the man who had consoled his infamous aunt on the
      eve of her execution&mdash;who had saved his unhappy cousin from poverty,
      from sorrow, from shame. And but one human being knew this. And that human
      being was myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing my agitation, Miss Jillgall placed her own construction on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything bad of Philip?&rdquo; she asked eagerly. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
      something that will prevent Helena from marrying him, tell me what it is,
      I beg and pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew no more of &ldquo;Philip&rdquo; (whom she still called by his Christian name!)
      than she had told me herself: there was no help for it but to disappoint
      her. At the same time I was unable to conceal that I was ill at ease, and
      that it might be well to leave me by myself. After a look round the
      bedchamber to see that nothing was wanting to my comfort, she made her
      quaint curtsey, and left me with her own inimitable form of farewell. &ldquo;Oh,
      indeed, I have been here too long! And I&rsquo;m afraid I have been guilty, once
      or twice, of vulgar familiarity. You will excuse me, I hope. This has been
      an exciting interview&mdash;I think I am going to cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran out of the room; and carried away with her some of my kindliest
      feelings, short as the time of our acquaintance had been. What a wife and
      what a mother was lost there&mdash;and all for want of a pretty face!
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, my thoughts inevitably reverted to Dunboyne the elder, and to
      all that had happened in Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s family since the Irish gentleman
      had written to me in bygone years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible choice of responsibilities which had preyed on the Minister&rsquo;s
      mind had been foreseen by Mr. Dunboyne, when he first thought of adopting
      his infant niece, and had warned him to dread what might happen in the
      future, if he brought her up as a member of the family with his own boy,
      and if the two young people became at a later period attached to each
      other. How had the wise foresight, which offered such a contrast to the
      poor Minister&rsquo;s impulsive act of mercy, met with its reward? Fate or
      Providence (call it which we may) had brought Dunboyne&rsquo;s son and the
      daughter of the murderess together; had inspired those two strangers with
      love; and had emboldened them to plight their troth by a marriage
      engagement. Was the man&rsquo;s betrayal of the trust placed in him by the
      faithful girl to be esteemed a fortunate circumstance by the two persons
      who knew the true story of her parentage, the Minister and myself? Could
      we rejoice in an act of infidelity which had embittered and darkened the
      gentle harmless life of the victim? Or could we, on the other hand,
      encourage the ruthless deceit, the hateful treachery, which had put the
      wicked Helena&mdash;with no exposure to dread if <i>she</i> married&mdash;into
      her wronged sister&rsquo;s place? Impossible! In the one case as in the other,
      impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally hopeless did the prospect appear, when I tried to determine what
      my own individual course of action ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my calmer moments, the idea had occurred to my mind of going to
      Dunboyne the younger, and, if he had any sense of shame left, exerting my
      influence to lead him back to his betrothed wife. How could I now do this,
      consistently with my duty to the young man&rsquo;s father; knowing what I knew,
      and not forgetting that I had myself advised Mr. Gracedieu to keep the
      truth concealed, when I was equally ignorant of Philip Dunboyne&rsquo;s
      parentage and of Helena Gracedieu&rsquo;s treachery?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if events so ordered it that the marriage of Eunice might yet take
      place&mdash;without any interference exerted to produce that result, one
      way or the other, on my part&mdash;it would be just as impossible for me
      to speak out now, as it had been in the long-past years when I had so
      cautiously answered Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s letter. But what would he think of me
      if accident led, sooner or later, to the disclosure which I had felt bound
      to conceal? The more I tried to forecast the chances of the future, the
      darker and the darker was the view that faced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my sinking heart and wearied mind, good Dame Nature presented a more
      acceptable prospect, when I happened to look out of the window of my room.
      There I saw the trees and flowerbeds of a garden, tempting me irresistibly
      under the cloudless sunshine of a fine day. I was on my way out, to
      recover heart and hope, when a knock at the door stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Miss Jillgall returned? When I said &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Mr. Gracedieu opened
      the door, and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so weak that he staggered as he approached me. Leading him to a
      chair, I noticed a wild look in his eyes, and a flush on his haggard
      cheeks. Something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were with me in my room,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;did I not tell you that I
      had forgotten something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have found the lost remembrance. My misfortune&mdash;I ought to
      call it the punishment for my sins, is recalled to me now. The worst curse
      that can fall on a father is the curse that has come to me. I have a
      wicked daughter. My own child, sir! my own child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had he been awake, while Miss Jillgall and I had been talking outside his
      door? Had he heard her ask me if Mr. Gracedieu had said nothing of
      Helena&rsquo;s infamous conduct to her sister, while he was speaking of Eunice?
      The way to the lost remembrance had perhaps been found there. In any case,
      after that bitter allusion to his &ldquo;wicked daughter&rdquo; some result must
      follow. Helena Gracedieu and a day of reckoning might be nearer to each
      other already than I had ventured to hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited anxiously for what he might say to me next.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE WANDERING MIND.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      For the moment, the Minister disappointed me.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Without speaking, without even looking up, he took out his pocketbook, and
      began to write in it. Constantly interrupted either by a trembling in the
      hand that held the pencil, or by a difficulty (as I imagined) in
      expressing thoughts imperfectly realized&mdash;his patience gave way; he
      dashed the book on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind is gone!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Oh, Father in Heaven, let death deliver
      me from a body without a mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who could hear him, and be guilty of the cruelty of preaching
      self-control? I picked up the pocketbook, and offered to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can at least try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fellow! What should I do without you? See now; here is my
      difficulty. I have got so many things to say, I want to separate them&mdash;or
      else they will all run into each other. Look at the book,&rdquo; my poor friend
      said mournfully; &ldquo;they have run into each other in spite of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entries proved to be nearly incomprehensible. Here and there I
      discovered some scattered words, which showed themselves more or less
      distinctly in the midst of the surrounding confusion. The first word that
      I could make out was &ldquo;Education.&rdquo; Helped by that hint, I trusted to
      guess-work to guide me in speaking to him. It was necessary to be
      positive, or he would have lost all faith in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you have something to say to me about the education
      which you have given to your daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put them together!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dear, patient, sweet Eunice must not
      be confounded with that she-devil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Mr. Gracedieu! Badly as Miss Helena has behaved, she is your
      own child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repudiate her, sir! Think for a moment of what she has done&mdash;and
      then think of the religious education that I have given her. Heartless!
      Deceitful! The most ignorant creature in the lowest dens of this town
      could have done nothing more basely cruel. And this, after years on years
      of patient Christian instruction on my part! What is religion? What is
      education? I read a horrible book once (I forget who was the author); it
      called religion superstition, and education empty form. I don&rsquo;t know; upon
      my word I don&rsquo;t know that the book may not&mdash;Oh, my tongue! Why don&rsquo;t
      I keep a guard over my tongue? Are you a father, too? Don&rsquo;t interrupt me.
      Put yourself in my place, and think of it. Heartless, deceitful, and <i>my</i>
      daughter. Give me the pocketbook; I want to see which memorandum comes
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had now wrought himself into a state of excitement, which relieved his
      spirits of the depression that had weighed on them up to this time. His
      harmless vanity, always, as I suspect, a latent quality in his kindly
      nature, had already restored his confidence. With a self-sufficient smile
      he consulted his own unintelligible entries, and made his own wild
      discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; &lsquo;M&rsquo; stands for Minister; I come first. Am I to blame? Am I&mdash;God
      forgive me my many sins&mdash;am I heartless? Am I deceitful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend, not even your enemies could say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Who comes next?&rdquo; He consulted the book again. &ldquo;Her mother, her
      sainted mother, comes next. People say she is like her mother. Was my wife
      heartless? Was the angel of my life deceitful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;is exactly what your wife was&mdash;and
      exactly what reappears in your wife&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does her wickedness come from?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Not from her mother;
      not from me; not from a neglected education.&rdquo; He suddenly stepped up to me
      and laid his hands on my shoulders; his voice dropped to hoarse, moaning,
      awestruck tones. &ldquo;Shall I tell you what it is? A possession of the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so evidently desirable to prevent any continuation of such a train
      of thought as this, that I could feel no hesitation in interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hear what I have to say?&rdquo; I asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His humor changed again; he made me a low bow, and went back to his chair.
      &ldquo;I will hear you with pleasure,&rdquo; he answered politely. &ldquo;You are the most
      eloquent man I know, with one exception&mdash;myself. Of course&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mere waste of time,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;to regret the excellent
      education which your daughter has misused.&rdquo; Making that reply, I was
      tempted to add another word of truth. All education is at the mercy of two
      powerful counter-influences: the influence of temperament, and the
      influence of circumstances. But this was philosophy. How could I expect
      him to submit to philosophy? &ldquo;What we know of Miss Helena,&rdquo; I went on,
      &ldquo;must be enough for us. She has plotted, and she means to succeed. Stop
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just my idea!&rdquo; he declared firmly. &ldquo;I refuse my consent to that
      abominable marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the popular phrase, I struck while the iron was hot. &ldquo;You must do more
      than that, sir,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His vanity suddenly took the alarm&mdash;I was leading him rather too
      undisguisedly. He handed his book back to me. &ldquo;You will find,&rdquo; he said
      loftily, &ldquo;that I have put it all down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pretended to find it, and read an imaginary entry to this effect: &ldquo;After
      what she has already done, Helena is capable of marrying in defiance of my
      wishes and commands. This must be considered and provided against.&rdquo; So
      far, I had succeeded in flattering him. But when (thinking of his paternal
      authority) I alluded next to his daughter&rsquo;s age, his eyes rested on me
      with a look of downright terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk of the girls&rsquo; ages even with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did he mean? It was useless to ask. I went on with the matter in hand&mdash;still
      deliberately speaking to him, as I might have spoken to a man with an
      intellect as clear as my own. In my experience, this practice generally
      stimulates a weak intelligence to do its best. We all know how children
      receive talk that is lowered, or books that are lowered, to their presumed
      level. &ldquo;I shall take it for granted,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that Miss Helena is
      still under your lawful authority. She can only arrive at her ends by
      means of a runaway marriage. In that case, much depends on the man. You
      told me you couldn&rsquo;t help liking him. This was, of course, before you knew
      of the infamous manner in which he has behaved. You must have changed your
      opinion now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be at a loss how to reply. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the young
      man was drawn into it by Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s apology for Philip Dunboyne repeated in other
      words. Despising and detesting the fellow as I did, I was forced to admit
      to myself that he must be recommended by personal attractions which it
      would be necessary to reckon with. I tried to get some more information
      from Mr. Gracedieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The excuse you have just made for him,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;implies that he is a
      weak man; easily persuaded, easily led.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister answered by nodding his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such weakness as that,&rdquo; I persisted, &ldquo;is a vice in itself. It has led
      already, sir, to the saddest results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He admitted this by another nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to shock you, Mr. Gracedieu; but I must recommend employing
      the means that present themselves. You must practice on this man&rsquo;s
      weakness, for the sake of the good that may come of it. I hear he is in
      London with his father. Try the strong influence, and write to his father.
      There is another reason besides for doing this. It is quite possible that
      the truth has been concealed from Mr. Dunboyne the elder. Take care that
      he is informed of what has really happened. Are you looking for pen, ink,
      and paper? Let me offer you the writing materials which I use in
      traveling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I placed them before him. He took up the pen; he arranged the paper; he
      was eager to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      After writing a few words, he stopped&mdash;reflected&mdash;tried again&mdash;stopped
      again&mdash;tore up the little that he had done&mdash;and began a new
      letter, ending in the same miserable result. It was impossible to witness
      his helplessness, to see how pitiably patient he was over his own
      incapacity, and to let the melancholy spectacle go on. I proposed to write
      the letter; authenticating it, of course, by his signature. When he
      allowed me to take the pen, he turned away his face, ashamed to let me see
      what he suffered. Was this the same man, whose great nature had so nobly
      asserted itself in the condemned cell? Poor mortality!
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was easily written.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only to inform Mr. Dunboyne of his son&rsquo;s conduct; repeating, in the
      plainest language that I could use, what Miss Jillgall had related to me.
      Arrived at the conclusion, I contrived to make Mr. Gracedieu express
      himself in these strong terms: &ldquo;I protest against the marriage in justice
      to you, sir, as well as to myself. We can neither of us content to be
      accomplices in an act of domestic treason of the basest kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence, the Minister read the letter, and attached his signature to
      it. In silence, he rose and took my arm. I asked if he wished to go to his
      room. He only replied by a sign. I offered to sit with him, and try to
      cheer him. Gratefully, he pressed my hand: gently, he put me back from the
      door. Crushed by the miserable discovery of the decay of his own
      faculties! What could I do? what could I say? Nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall was in the drawing-room. With the necessary explanations, I
      showed her the letter. She read it with breathless interest. &ldquo;It terrifies
      one to think how much depends on old Mr. Dunboyne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know
      him. What sort of man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only assure her (after what I remembered of his letter to me) that
      he was a man whom we could depend upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall possessed treasures of information to which I could lay no
      claim. Mr. Dunboyne, she told me, was a scholar, and a writer, and a rich
      man. His views on marriage were liberal in the extreme. Let his son find
      good principles, good temper, and good looks, in a wife, and he would
      promise to find the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get these particulars,&rdquo; said Miss Jillgall, &ldquo;from dear Euneece. They
      are surely encouraging? That Helena may carry out Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s views in
      her personal appearance is, I regret to say, what I can&rsquo;t deny. But as to
      the other qualifications, how hopeful is the prospect! Good principles,
      and good temper? Ha! ha! Helena has the principles of Jezebel, and the
      temper of Lady Macbeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dashing off this striking sketch of character, the fair artist asked
      to look at my letter again, and observed that the address was wanting. &ldquo;I
      can set this right for you,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;thanks, as before, to my sweet
      Euneece. And (don&rsquo;t be in a hurry) I can make myself useful in another
      way. Oh, how I do enjoy making myself useful! If you trust your letter to
      the basket in the hall, Helena&rsquo;s lovely eyes&mdash;capable of the meanest
      conceivable actions&mdash;are sure to take a peep at the address. In that
      case, do you think your letter would get to London? I am afraid you detect
      a faint infusion of spitefulness in that question. Oh, for shame! I&rsquo;ll
      post the letter myself.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE SHAMELESS SISTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some reason, which my unassisted penetration was unable to discover,
      Miss Helena Gracedieu kept out of my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, on the day of my arrival, and at breakfast on the next morning,
      she was present of course; ready to make herself agreeable in a modest
      way, and provided with the necessary supply of cheerful small-talk. But
      the meal having come to an end, she had her domestic excuse ready, and
      unostentatiously disappeared like a well-bred young lady. I never met her
      on the stairs, never found myself intruding on her in the drawing-room,
      never caught her getting out of my way in the garden. As much at a loss
      for an explanation of these mysteries as I was, Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s interest
      in my welfare led her to caution me in a vague and general way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my word for it, dear Mr. Governor, she has some design on you. Will
      you allow an insignificant old maid to offer a suggestion? Oh, thank you;
      I will venture to advise. Please look back at your experience of the very
      worst female prisoner you ever had to deal with&mdash;and be guided
      accordingly if Helena catches you at a private interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour afterward, Helena caught me. I was writing in my
      room, when the maidservant came in with a message: &ldquo;Miss Helena&rsquo;s
      compliments, sir, and would you please spare her half an hour,
      downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My first excuse was of course that I was engaged. This was disposed of by
      a second message, provided beforehand, no doubt, for an anticipated
      refusal: &ldquo;Miss Helena wished me to say, sir, that her time is your time.&rdquo;
       I was still obstinate; I pleaded next that my day was filled up. A third
      message had evidently been prepared, even for this emergency: &ldquo;Miss Helena
      will regret, sir, having the pleasure deferred, but she will leave you to
      make your own appointment for to-morrow.&rdquo; Persistency so inveterate as
      this led to a result which Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s cautious daughter had not
      perhaps contemplated: it put me on my guard. There seemed to be a chance,
      to say the least of it, that I might serve Eunice&rsquo;s interests if I
      discovered what the enemy had to say. I locked up my writing&mdash;declared
      myself incapable of putting Miss Helena to needless inconvenience&mdash;and
      followed the maid to the lower floor of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room to which I was conducted proved to be empty. I looked round me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been told that a man lived there who was absolutely indifferent
      to appearances, I should have concluded that his views were faithfully
      represented by his place of abode. The chairs and tables reminded me of a
      railway waiting-room. The shabby little bookcase was the mute record of a
      life indifferent to literature. The carpet was of that dreadful drab
      color, still the cherished favorite of the average English mind, in spite
      of every protest that can be entered against it, on behalf of Art. The
      ceiling, recently whitewashed; made my eyes ache when they looked at it.
      On either side of the window, flaccid green curtains hung helplessly with
      nothing to loop them up. The writing-desk and the paper-case, viewed as
      specimens of woodwork, recalled the ready-made bedrooms on show in cheap
      shops. The books, mostly in slate-colored bindings, were devoted to the
      literature which is called religious; I only discovered three worldly
      publications among them&mdash;Domestic Cookery, Etiquette for Ladies, and
      Hints on the Breeding of Poultry. An ugly little clock, ticking noisily in
      a black case, and two candlesticks of base metal placed on either side of
      it, completed the ornaments on the chimney-piece. Neither pictures nor
      prints hid the barrenness of the walls. I saw no needlework and no
      flowers. The one object in the place which showed any pretensions to
      beauty was a looking-glass in an elegant gilt frame&mdash;sacred to
      vanity, and worthy of the office that it filled. Such was Helena
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s sitting-room. I really could not help thinking: How like her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in with a face perfectly adapted to the circumstances&mdash;pleased
      and smiling; amiably deferential, in consideration of the claims of her
      father&rsquo;s guest&mdash;and, to my surprise, in some degree suggestive of one
      of those incorrigible female prisoners, to whom Miss Jillgall had referred
      me when she offered a word of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind of you to come so soon! Excuse my receiving you in my
      housekeeping-room; we shall not be interrupted here. Very plainly
      furnished, is it not? I dislike ostentation and display. Ornaments are out
      of place in a room devoted to domestic necessities. I hate domestic
      necessities. You notice the looking-glass? It&rsquo;s a present. I should never
      have put such a thing up. Perhaps my vanity excuses it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed the last remark by a look at herself in the glass; using it,
      while she despised it. Yes: there was a handsome face, paying her its
      reflected compliment&mdash;but not so well matched as it might have been
      by a handsome figure. Her feet were too large; her shoulders were too
      high; the graceful undulations of a well-made girl were absent when she
      walked; and her bosom was, to my mind, unduly developed for her time of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down by me with her back to the light. Happening to be opposite to
      the window, I offered her the advantage of a clear view of my face. She
      waited for me, and I waited for her&mdash;and there was an awkward pause
      before we spoke. She set the example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it curious?&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;When two people have something
      particular to say to each other, and nothing to hinder them, they never
      seem to know how to say it. You are the oldest, sir. Why don&rsquo;t you begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have nothing particular to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain words, you mean that I must begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I want to know whether I have given you (and Miss Jillgall, of
      course) as much time as you want, and as many opportunities as you could
      desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray go on, Miss Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not said enough already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough, I regret to say, to convey your meaning to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her chair a little further away from me. &ldquo;I am sadly
      disappointed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had such a high opinion of your perfect
      candor. I thought to myself: There is such a striking expression of
      frankness in his face. Another illusion gone! I hope you won&rsquo;t think I am
      offended, if I say a bold word. I am only a young girl, to be sure; but I
      am not quite such a fool as you take me for. Do you really think I don&rsquo;t
      know that Miss Jillgall has been telling you everything that is bad about
      me; putting every mistake that I have made, every fault that I have
      committed, in the worst possible point of view? And you have listened to
      her&mdash;quite naturally! And you are prejudiced, strongly prejudiced,
      against me&mdash;what else could you be, under the circumstances? I don&rsquo;t
      complain; I have purposely kept out of your way, and out of Miss
      Jillgall&rsquo;s way; in short, I have afforded you every facility, as the
      prospectuses say. I only want to know if my turn has come at last. Once
      more, have I given you time enough, and opportunities enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal more than enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you have made up your mind about me without stopping to
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I mean. An act of treachery, Miss Helena, <i>is</i>
      an act of treachery; no honest person need hesitate to condemn it. I am
      sorry you sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up to go. With an ironical gesture of remonstrance, she signed to me
      to sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I remind you, dear sir, of our famous native virtue? Fair play is
      surely due to a young person who has nobody to take her part. You talked
      of treachery just how. I deny the treachery. Please give me a hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or would you prefer waiting,&rdquo; she went out, &ldquo;till my sister comes here
      later in the day, and continues what Miss Jillgall has begun, with the
      great advantage of being young and nice-looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the female mind gets into this state, no wise man answers the female
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take silence as meaning Go on?&rdquo; Miss Helena inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged her to interpret my silence in the sense most agreeable to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This naturally encouraged her. She made a proposal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind changing places, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like, Miss Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We changed chairs; the light now fell full on her face. Had she
      deliberately challenged me to look into her secret mind if I could?
      Anything like the stark insensibility of that young girl to every
      refinement of feeling, to every becoming doubt of herself, to every
      customary timidity of her age and sex in the presence of a man who had not
      disguised his unfavorable opinion of her, I never met with in all my
      experience of the world and of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to be quite mistress of myself,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;your face, for
      some reason which I really don&rsquo;t know, irritates me. The fact is, I have
      great pride in keeping my temper. Please make allowances. Now about Miss
      Jillgall. I suppose she told you how my sister first met with Philip
      Dunboyne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She also mentioned, perhaps, that he was a highly-cultivated man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shall get on. When Philip came to our town here, and saw me for
      the first time&mdash;Do you object to my speaking familiarly of him, by
      his Christian name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the case of any one else in your position, Miss Helena, I should
      venture to call it bad taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was provoked into saying that. It failed entirely as a well-meant effort
      in the way of implied reproof. Miss Helena smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grant me a liberty which you would not concede to another girl.&rdquo; That
      was how she viewed it. &ldquo;We are getting on better already. To return to
      what I was saying. When Philip first saw me&mdash;I have it from himself,
      mind&mdash;he felt that I should have been his choice, if he had met with
      me before he met with my sister. Do you blame him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take my advice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will not inquire too closely
      into my opinion of Mr. Philip Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t wish me to say anymore?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, pray go on, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that concession, she was amiability itself. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she assured
      me, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easily done.&rdquo; And she went on accordingly: &ldquo;Philip having
      informed me of the state of his affections, I naturally followed his
      example. In fact, we exchanged confessions. Our marriage engagement
      followed as a matter of course. Do you blame me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait till you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made that amazing reply with such perfect composure, that I began to
      fear there must have been some misunderstanding between us. &ldquo;Is that
      really all you have to say for yourself?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her patience with me was most exemplary. She lowered herself to my level.
      Not trusting to words only on this occasion, she (so to say) beat her
      meaning into my head by gesticulating on her fingers, as if she was
      educating a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip and I,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;are the victims of an accident, which kept us
      apart when we ought to have met together&mdash;we are not responsible for
      an accident.&rdquo; She impressed this on me by touching her forefinger. &ldquo;Philip
      and I fell in love with each other at first sight&mdash;we are not
      responsible for the feelings implanted in our natures by an all-wise
      Providence.&rdquo; She assisted me in understanding this by touching her middle
      finger. &ldquo;Philip and I owe a duty to each other, and accept a
      responsibility under those circumstances&mdash;the responsibility of
      getting married.&rdquo; A touch on her third finger, and an indulgent bow,
      announced that the lesson was ended. &ldquo;I am not a clever man like you,&rdquo; she
      modestly acknowledged, &ldquo;but I ask you to help us, when you next see my
      father, with some confidence. You know exactly what to say to him, by this
      time. Nothing has been forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a person has been forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? What person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little perplexed at first, Miss Helena reflected, and recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I was afraid I might be obliged to trouble you for
      an explanation&mdash;I see it now. You are shocked (very properly) when
      feelings of enmity exist between near relations; and you wish to be
      assured that I bear no malice toward Eunice. She is violent, she is sulky,
      she is stupid, she is selfish; and she cruelly refuses to live in the same
      house with me. Make your mind easy, sir, I forgive my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let me not attempt to disguise it&mdash;Miss Helena Gracedieu confounded
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinary audacity is one of those forms of insolence which mature
      experience dismisses with contempt. This girl&rsquo;s audacity struck down all
      resistance, for one shocking reason: it was unquestionably sincere. Strong
      conviction of her own virtue stared at me in her proud and daring eyes. At
      that time, I was not aware of what I have learned since. The horrid
      hardening of her moral sense had been accomplished by herself. In her
      diary, there has been found the confession of a secret course of reading&mdash;with
      supplementary reflections flowing from it, which need only to be described
      as worthy of their source.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person capable of repentance and reform would, in her place, have seen
      that she had disgusted me. Not a suspicion of this occurred to Miss
      Helena. &ldquo;I see you are embarrassed,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;and I am at no loss to
      account for it. You are too polite to acknowledge that I have not made a
      friend of you yet. Oh, I mean to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Sooner or later, you will find yourself
      saying a kind word to my father for Philip and me.&rdquo; She rose, and took a
      turn in the room&mdash;and stopped, eying me attentively. &ldquo;Are you
      thinking of Eunice?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has your sympathy, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart-felt sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t ask how I stand in your estimation, after that. Pray express
      yourself freely. Your looks confess it&mdash;you view me with a feeling of
      aversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I view you with a feeling of horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exasperating influences of her language, her looks, and her tones
      would, as I venture to think, have got to the end of another man&rsquo;s
      self-control before this. Anyway, she had at last irritated me into
      speaking as strongly as I felt. What I said had been so plainly (perhaps
      so rudely) expressed, that misinterpretation of it seemed to be
      impossible. She mistook me, nevertheless. The most merciless disclosure of
      the dreary side of human destiny is surely to be found in the failure of
      words, spoken or written, so to answer their purpose that we can trust
      them, in our attempts to communicate with each other. Even when he seems
      to be connected, by the nearest and dearest relations, with his
      fellow-mortals, what a solitary creature, tried by the test of sympathy,
      the human being really is in the teeming world that he inhabits! Affording
      one more example of the impotence of human language to speak for itself,
      my misinterpreted words had found their way to the one sensitive place in
      Helena Gracedieu&rsquo;s impenetrable nature. She betrayed it in the quivering
      and flushing of her hard face, and in the appeal to the looking-glass
      which escaped her eyes the next moment. My hasty reply had roused the idea
      of a covert insult addressed to her handsome face. In other words, I had
      wounded her vanity. Driven by resentment, out came the secret distrust of
      me which had been lurking in that cold heart, from the moment when we
      first met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inspire you with horror, and Eunice inspires you with compassion,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;That, Mr. Governor, is not natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want an explanation, Miss Helena, if that is what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your explanation, then! You are not the stranger you are said to be
      to my sister and to me. Your interest in Eunice is a personal interest of
      some kind. I don&rsquo;t pretend to guess what it is. As for myself, it is plain
      that somebody else has been setting you against me, before Miss Jillgall
      got possession of your private ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In alluding to Eunice, she had blundered, strangely enough, on something
      like the truth. But when she spoke of herself, the headlong malignity of
      her suspicions&mdash;making every allowance for the anger that had hurried
      her into them&mdash;seemed to call for some little protest against a false
      assertion. I told her that she was completely mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am completely right,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw you pretending to be a stranger to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it when we met at the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was too ridiculous for the preservation of any control over my
      own sense of humor. It was wrong; but it was inevitable&mdash;I laughed.
      She looked at me with a fury, revealing a concentration of evil passion in
      her which I had not seen yet. I asked her pardon; I begged her to think a
      little before she persisted in taking a view of my conduct unworthy of
      her, and unjust to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unjust to You!&rdquo; she burst out. &ldquo;Who are You? A man who has driven your
      trade has spies always at his command&mdash;yes! and knows how to use
      them. You were primed with private information&mdash;you had, for all I
      know, a stolen photograph of me in your pocket&mdash;before ever you came
      to our town. Do you still deny it? Oh, sir, why degrade yourself by
      telling a lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No such outrage as this had ever been inflicted on me, at any time in my
      life. My forbearance must, I suppose, have been more severely tried than I
      was aware of myself. With or without excuse for me, I was weak enough to
      let a girl&rsquo;s spiteful tongue sting me, and, worse still, to let her see
      that I felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have no second opportunity, Miss Gracedieu, of insulting me.&rdquo;
       With that foolish reply, I opened the door violently and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran after me, triumphing in having roused the temper of a man old
      enough to have been her grandfather, and caught me by the arm. &ldquo;Your own
      conduct has exposed you.&rdquo; (That was literally how she expressed herself.)
      &ldquo;I saw it in your eyes when we met at the station. You, the stranger&mdash;you
      who allowed poor ignorant me to introduce myself&mdash;you knew me all the
      time, knew me by sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook her hand off with an inconsiderable roughness, humiliating to
      remember. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s false!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I knew you by your likeness to your
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the words had passed my lips, I came to my senses again; I
      remembered what fatal words they might prove to be, if they reached the
      Minister&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heard only by his daughter, my reply seemed to cool the heat of her anger
      in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you knew my mother?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My father never told us that, when he
      spoke of your being such a very old friend of his. Strange, to say the
      least of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was wise enough&mdash;now when wisdom had come too late&mdash;not to
      attempt to explain myself, and not to give her an opportunity of saying
      more. &ldquo;We are neither of us in a state of mind,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;to allow
      this interview to continue. I must try to recover my composure; and I
      leave you to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the solitude of my room, I was able to look my position fairly in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s wife had come to me, in the long-past time, without her
      husband&rsquo;s knowledge. Tempted to a cruel resolve by the maternal triumph of
      having an infant of her own, she had resolved to rid herself of the poor
      little rival in her husband&rsquo;s fatherly affection, by consigning the
      adopted child to the keeping of a charitable asylum. She had dared to ask
      me to help her. I had kept the secret of her shameful visit&mdash;I can
      honestly say, for the Minister&rsquo;s sake. And now, long after time had doomed
      those events to oblivion, they were revived&mdash;and revived by me.
      Thanks to my folly, Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughter knew what I had concealed
      from Mr. Gracedieu himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What course did respect for my friend, and respect for myself, counsel me
      to take?
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only see before me a choice of two evils. To wait for events&mdash;with
      the too certain prospect of a vindictive betrayal of my indiscretion by
      Helena Gracedieu. Or to take the initiative into my own hands, and risk
      consequences which I might regret to the end of my life, by making my
      confession to the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had decided, somebody knocked at the door. It was the
      maid-servant again. Was it possible she had been sent by Helena?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. My master wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE GIRLS&rsquo; AGES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Had the Minister&rsquo;s desire to see me been inspired by his daughter&rsquo;s
      betrayal of what I had unfortunately said to her? Although he would
      certainly not consent to receive her personally, she would be at liberty
      to adopt a written method of communication with him, and the letter might
      be addressed in such a manner as to pique his curiosity. If Helena&rsquo;s
      vindictive purpose had been already accomplished&mdash;and if Mr.
      Gracedieu left me no alternative but to present his unworthy wife in her
      true character&mdash;I can honestly say that I dreaded the consequences,
      not as they might affect myself, but as they might affect my unhappy
      friend in his enfeebled state of body and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I entered his room, he was still in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed-curtains were so drawn, on the side nearest to the window, as to
      keep the light from falling too brightly on his weak eyes. In the shadow
      thus thrown on him, it was not possible to see his face plainly enough,
      from the open side of the bed, to arrive at any definite conclusion as to
      what might be passing in his mind. After having been awake for some hours
      during the earlier part of the night, he had enjoyed a long and
      undisturbed sleep. &ldquo;I feel stronger this morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I wish to
      speak to you while my mind is clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the quiet tone of his voice was not an assumed tone, he was surely
      ignorant of all that had passed between his daughter and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eunice will be here soon,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;and I ought to explain why I
      have sent for her to come and meet you. I have reasons, serious reasons,
      mind, for wishing you to compare her personal appearance with Helena&rsquo;s
      personal appearance, and then to tell me which of the two, on a fair
      comparison, looks the eldest. Pray bear in mind that I attach the greatest
      importance to the conclusion at which you may arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke more clearly and collectedly than I had heard him speak yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there I detected hesitations and repetitions, which I have
      purposely passed over. The substance of what he said to me is all that I
      shall present in this place. Careful as I have been to keep my record of
      events within strict limits, I have written at a length which I was far
      indeed from contemplating when I accepted Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having promised to comply with the strange request which he had addressed
      to me, I ventured to remind him of past occasions on which he had
      pointedly abstained, when the subject presented itself, from speaking of
      the girls&rsquo; ages. &ldquo;You have left it to my discretion,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to decide
      a question in which you are seriously interested, relating to your
      daughters. Have I no excuse for regretting that I have not been admitted
      to your confidence a little more freely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have every excuse,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But you trouble me all the same.
      There was something else that I had to say to you&mdash;and your curiosity
      gets in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this with a sullen emphasis. In my position, the worst of evils
      was suspense. I told him that my curiosity could wait; and I begged that
      he would relieve his mind of what was pressing on it at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think a little,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited anxiously for the decision at which he might arrive. Nothing came
      of it to justify my misgivings. &ldquo;Leave what I have in my mind to ripen in
      my mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The mystery about the girls&rsquo; ages seems to irritate
      you. If I put my good friend&rsquo;s temper to any further trial, he will be of
      no use to me. Never mind if my head swims; I&rsquo;m used to that. Now listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange as the preface was, the explanation that followed was stranger
      yet. I offer a shortened and simplified version, giving accurately the
      substance of what I heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister entered without reserve on the mysterious subject of the
      ages. Eunice, he informed me, was nearly two years older than Helena. If
      she outwardly showed her superiority of age, any person acquainted with
      the circumstances under which the adopted infant had been received into
      Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s childless household, need only compare the so-called
      sisters in after-life, and would thereupon identify the eldest-looking
      young lady of the two as the offspring of the woman who had been hanged
      for murder. With such a misfortune as this presenting itself as a possible
      prospect, the Minister was bound to prevent the girls from ignorantly
      betraying each other by allusions to their ages and their birthdays. After
      much thought, he had devised a desperate means of meeting the difficulty&mdash;already
      made known, as I am told, for the information of strangers who may read
      the pages that have gone before mine. My friend&rsquo;s plan of proceeding had,
      by the nature of it, exposed him to injurious comment, to embarrassing
      questions, and to doubts and misconceptions, all patiently endured in
      consideration of the security that had been attained. Proud of his
      explanation, Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s vanity called upon me to acknowledge that my
      curiosity had been satisfied, and my doubts completely set at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      No: my obstinate common sense was not reduced to submission, even yet.
      Looking back over a lapse of seventeen years, I asked what had happened,
      in that long interval, to justify the anxieties which still appeared to
      trouble my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, my harmless curiosity could be gratified by a reply expressed
      in three words&mdash;nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, was the Minister afraid of?
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice dropped to a whisper. He said: &ldquo;I am afraid of the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who were the women?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of them actually proved to be the servants employed in Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      house, at the bygone time when he had brought the child home with him from
      the prison! To point out the absurdity of the reasons that he gave for
      fearing what female curiosity might yet attempt, if circumstances happened
      to encourage it, would have been a mere waste of words. Dismissing the
      subject, I next ascertained that the Minister&rsquo;s doubts extended even to
      the two female warders, who had been appointed to watch the murderess in
      turn, during her last days in prison. I easily relieved his mind in this
      case. One of the warders was dead. The other had married a farmer in
      Australia. Had we exhausted the list of suspected persons yet? No: there
      was one more left; and the Minister declared that he had first met with
      her in my official residence, at the time when I was Governor of the
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She presented herself to me by name,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and she spoke rudely. A
      Miss&mdash;&rdquo; He paused to consult his memory, and this time (thanks
      perhaps to his night&rsquo;s rest) his memory answered the appeal. &ldquo;I have got
      it!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend had interested me in his imaginary perils at last. It was just
      possible that he might have a formidable person to deal with now.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my residence at Florence, the Chaplain and I had taken many a
      retrospective look (as old men will) at past events in our lives. My
      former colleague spoke of the time when he had performed clerical duty for
      his friend, the rector of a parish church in London. Neither he nor I had
      heard again of the &ldquo;Miss Chance&rdquo; of our disagreeable prison experience,
      whom he had married to the dashing Dutch gentleman, Mr. Tenbruggen. We
      could only wonder what had become of that mysterious married pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gracedieu being undoubtedly ignorant of the woman&rsquo;s marriage, it was
      not easy to say what the consequence might be, in his excitable state, if
      I informed him of it. He would, in all probability, conclude that I knew
      more of the woman than he did. I decided on keeping my own counsel, for
      the present at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing at once, therefore, to the one consideration of any importance, I
      endeavored to find out whether Mr. Gracedieu and Mrs. Tenbruggen had met,
      or had communicated with each other in any way, during the long period of
      separation that had taken place between the Minister and myself. If he had
      been so unlucky as to offend her, she was beyond all doubt an enemy to be
      dreaded. Apart, however, from a misfortune of this kind, she would rank,
      in my opinion, with the other harmless objects of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making my inquiries, I found that I had an obstacle to contend with.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he felt the renovating influence of the repose that he enjoyed, the
      Minister had been able to think and to express himself with less
      difficulty than usual. But the reserves of strength, on which the useful
      exercise of his memory depended, began to fail him as the interview
      proceeded. He distinctly recollected that &ldquo;something unpleasant had passed
      between that audacious woman and himself.&rdquo; But at what date&mdash;and
      whether by word of mouth or by correspondence&mdash;was more than his
      memory could now recall. He believed he was not mistaken in telling me
      that he &ldquo;had been in two minds about her.&rdquo; At one time, he was satisfied
      that he had taken wise measures for his own security, if she attempted to
      annoy him. But there was another and a later time, when doubts and fears
      had laid hold of him again. If I wanted to know how this had happened, he
      fancied it was through a dream; and if I asked what the dream was, he
      could only beg and pray that I would spare his poor head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling even yet to submit unconditionally to defeat, it occurred to me
      to try a last experiment on my friend, without calling for any mental
      effort on his own part. The &ldquo;Miss Chance&rdquo; of former days might, by a bare
      possibility, have written to him. I asked accordingly if he was in the
      habit of keeping his letters, and if he would allow me (when he had rested
      a little) to lay them open before him, so that he could look at the
      signatures. &ldquo;You might find the lost recollection in that way,&rdquo; I
      suggested, &ldquo;at the bottom of one of your letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in that state of weariness, poor fellow, in which a man will do
      anything for the sake of peace. Pointing to a cabinet in his room, he gave
      me a key taken from a little basket on his bed. &ldquo;Look for yourself,&rdquo; he
      said. After some hesitation&mdash;for I naturally recoiled from examining
      another man&rsquo;s correspondence&mdash;I decided on opening the cabinet, at
      any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters&mdash;a large collection&mdash;were, to my relief, all neatly
      folded, and indorsed with the names of the writers. I could run harmlessly
      through bundle after bundle in search of the one name that I wanted, and
      still respect the privacy of the letters. My perseverance deserved a
      reward&mdash;and failed to get it. The name I wanted steadily eluded my
      search. Arriving at the upper shelf of the cabinet, I found it so high
      that I could barely reach it with my hand. Instead of getting more letters
      to look over, I pulled down two newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them was an old copy of the <i>Times</i>, dating back as far as the
      13th December, 1858. It was carefully folded, longwise, with the
      title-page uppermost. On the first column, at the left-hand side of the
      sheet, appeared the customary announcements of Births. A mark with a blue
      pencil, against one of the advertisements, attracted my attention. I read
      these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 10th inst., the wife of the Rev. Abel Gracedieu, of a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second newspaper bore a later date, and contained nothing that
      interested me. I naturally assumed that the advertisement in the <i>Times</i>
      had been inserted at the desire of Mrs. Gracedieu; and, after all that I
      had heard, there was little difficulty in attributing the curious omission
      of the place in which the child had been born to the caution of her
      husband. If Mrs. Tenbruggen (then Miss Chance) had happened to see the
      advertisement in the great London newspaper, Mr. Gracedieu might yet have
      good reason to congratulate himself on his prudent method of providing
      against mischievous curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned toward the bed and looked at him. His eyes were closed. Was he
      sleeping? Or was he trying to remember what he had desired to say to me,
      when the demands which I made on his memory had obliged him to wait for a
      later opportunity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way, there was something that quickened my sympathies, in the
      spectacle of his helpless repose. It suggested to me personal reasons for
      his anxieties, which he had not mentioned, and which I had not thought of,
      up to this time. If the discovery that he dreaded took place, his
      household would be broken up, and his position as pastor would suffer in
      the estimation of the flock. His own daughter would refuse to live under
      the same roof with the daughter of an infamous woman. Popular opinion,
      among his congregation, judging a man who had passed off the child of
      other parents as his own, would find that man guilty of an act of
      deliberate deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still oppressed by reflections which pointed to the future in this
      discouraging way, I was startled by a voice outside the door&mdash;a
      sweet, sad voice&mdash;saying, &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister&rsquo;s eyes opened instantly: he raised himself in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eunice, at last!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let her in.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. THE ADOPTED CHILD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I opened the door.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Eunice passed me with the suddenness almost of a flash of light. When I
      turned toward the bed, her arms were round her father&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Oh, poor
      papa, how ill you look!&rdquo; Commonplace expressions of fondness, and no more;
      but the tone gave them a charm that subdued me. Never had I felt so
      indulgent toward Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s unreasonable fears as when I saw him in
      the embrace of his adopted daughter. She had already reminded me of the
      bygone day when a bright little child had sat on my knee and listened to
      the ticking of my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister gently lifted her head from his breast. &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t see my old friend. Love him, and look up to him, Eunice.
      He will be your friend, too, when I am gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came to me and offered her cheek to be kissed. It was sadly pale, poor
      soul&mdash;and I could guess why. But her heart was now full of her
      father. &ldquo;Do you think he is seriously ill?&rdquo; she whispered. What I ought to
      have said I don&rsquo;t know. Her eyes, the sweetest, truest, loveliest eyes I
      ever saw in a human face, were pleading with me. Let my enemies make the
      worst of it, if they like&mdash;I did certainly lie. And if I deserved my
      punishment, I got it; the poor child believed me! &ldquo;Now I am happier,&rdquo; she
      said, gratefully. &ldquo;Only to hear your voice seems to encourage me. On our
      way here, Selina did nothing but talk of you. She told me I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      time to feel afraid of the great man; he would make me fond of him
      directly. I said, &lsquo;Are you fond of him?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Madly in love with
      him, my dear.&rsquo; My little friend really thinks you like her, and is very
      proud of it. There are some people who call her ugly. I hope you don&rsquo;t
      agree with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believe I should have lied again, if Mr. Gracedieu had not called me to
      the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does she strike you?&rdquo; he whispered, eagerly. &ldquo;Is it too soon to ask
      if she shows her age in her face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither in her face nor her figure,&rdquo; I answered: &ldquo;it astonishes me that
      you can ever have doubted it. No stranger, judging by personal appearance,
      could fail to make the mistake of thinking Helena the oldest of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked fondly at Eunice. &ldquo;Her figure seems to bear out what you say,&rdquo;
       he went on. &ldquo;Almost childish, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not agree to that. Slim, supple, simply graceful in every
      movement, Eunice&rsquo;s figure, in the charm of first youth, only waited its
      perfect development. Most men, looking at her as she stood at the other
      end of the room with her back toward us, would have guessed her age to be
      sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that I failed to agree with him, Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s misgivings
      returned. &ldquo;You speak very confidently,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;considering that you
      have not seen the girls together. Think what a dreadful blow it would be
      to me if you made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I declared, with perfect sincerity, that there was no fear of a mistake.
      The bare idea of making the proposed comparison was hateful to me. If
      Helena and I had happened to meet at that moment, I should have turned
      away from her by instinct&mdash;she would have disturbed my impressions of
      Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister signed to me to move a little nearer to him. &ldquo;I must say it,&rdquo;
       he whispered, &ldquo;and I am afraid of her hearing me. Is there anything in her
      face that reminds you of her miserable mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had hardly patience to answer the question: it was simply preposterous.
      Her hair was by many shades darker than her mother&rsquo;s hair; her eyes were
      of a different color. There was an exquisite tenderness and sincerity in
      their expression&mdash;made additionally beautiful, to my mind, by a
      gentle, uncomplaining sadness. It was impossible even to think of the eyes
      of the murderess when I looked at her child. Eunice&rsquo;s lower features,
      again, had none of her mother&rsquo;s regularity of proportion. Her smile,
      simple and sweet, and soon passing away, was certainly not an inherited
      smile on the maternal side. Whether she resembled her father, I was unable
      to conjecture&mdash;having never seen him. The one thing certain was, that
      not the faintest trace, in feature or expression, of Eunice&rsquo;s mother was
      to be seen in Eunice herself. Of the two girls, Helena&mdash;judging by
      something in the color of her hair, and by something in the shade of her
      complexion&mdash;might possibly have suggested, in those particulars only,
      a purely accidental resemblance to my terrible prisoner of past times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revival of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s spirits indicated a temporary change only,
      and was already beginning to pass away. The eyes which had looked lovingly
      at Eunice began to look languidly now: his head sank on the pillow with a
      sigh of weak content. &ldquo;My pleasure has been almost too much for me,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Leave me for a while to rest, and get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eunice kissed his forehead&mdash;and we left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. THE BRUISED HEART.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we stepped out on the landing, I observed that my companion paused.
      She looked at the two flights of stairs below us before she descended
      them. It occurred to me that there must be somebody in the house whom she
      was anxious to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the lower hall, she paused again, and proposed in a whisper
      that we should go into the garden. As we advanced along the backward
      division of the hall, I saw her eyes turn distrustfully toward the door of
      the room in which Helena had received me. At last, my slow perceptions
      felt with her and understood her. Eunice&rsquo;s sensitive nature recoiled from
      a chance meeting with the wretch who had laid waste all that had once been
      happy and hopeful in that harmless young life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me to the part of the garden that I am fondest of?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered her my arm. She led me in silence to a rustic seat, placed under
      the shade of a mulberry tree. I saw a change in her face as we sat down&mdash;a
      tender and beautiful change. At that moment the girl&rsquo;s heart was far away
      from me. There was some association with this corner of the garden, on
      which I felt that I must not intrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was once very happy here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When the time of the heartache
      came soon after, I was afraid to look at the old tree and the bench under
      it. But that is all over now. I like to remember the hours that were once
      dear to me, and to see the place that recalls them. Do you know who I am
      thinking of? Don&rsquo;t be afraid of distressing me. I never cry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I have heard your sad story&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t trust myself
      to speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are so sorry for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No words can say how sorry I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not angry with Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not angry! My poor dear, I am afraid to tell you how angry I am with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! You mustn&rsquo;t say that. If you wish to be kind to me&mdash;and I am
      sure you do wish it&mdash;don&rsquo;t think bitterly of Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I remember that the first feeling she roused in me was nothing
      worthier of a professing Christian than astonishment, I drop in my own
      estimation to the level of a savage. &ldquo;Do you really mean,&rdquo; I was base
      enough to ask, &ldquo;that you have forgiven him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said, gently: &ldquo;How could I help forgiving him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who could have been blessed with such love as this, and who could
      have cast it away from him, can have been nothing but an idiot. On that
      ground&mdash;though I dared not confess it to Eunice&mdash;I forgave him,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I surprise you?&rdquo; she asked simply. &ldquo;Perhaps love will bear any
      humiliation. Or perhaps I am only a poor weak creature. You don&rsquo;t know
      what a comfort it was to me to keep the few letters that I received from
      Philip. When I heard that he had gone away, I gave his letters the kiss
      that bade him good-by. That was the time, I think, when my poor bruised
      heart got used to the pain; I began to feel that there was one consolation
      still left for me&mdash;I might end in forgiving him. Why do I tell you
      all this? I think you must have bewitched me. Is this really the first
      time I have seen you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her little trembling hand into mine; I lifted it to my lips, and
      kissed it. Sorely was I tempted to own that I had pitied and loved her in
      her infancy. It was almost on my lips to say: &ldquo;I remember you an
      easily-pleased little creature, amusing yourself with the broken toys
      which were once the playthings of my own children.&rdquo; I believe I should
      have said it, if I could have trusted myself to speak composedly to her.
      This was not to be done. Old as I was, versed as I was in the hard
      knowledge of how to keep the mask on in the hour of need, this was not to
      be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still trying to understand that I was little better than a stranger to
      her, and still bent on finding the secret of the sympathy that united us,
      Eunice put a strange question to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were young yourself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you know what it was to
      love, and to be loved&mdash;and then to lose it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not given to many men to marry the woman who has been the object of
      their first love. My early life had been darkened by a sad story; never
      confided to any living creature; banished resolutely from my own thoughts.
      For forty years past, that part of my buried self had lain quiet in its
      grave&mdash;and the chance touch of an innocent hand had raised the dead,
      and set us face to face again! Did I know what it was to love, and to be
      loved, and then to lose it all? &ldquo;Too well, my child; too well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all I could say to her. In the last days of my life, I shrank
      from speaking of it. When I had first felt that calamity, and had felt it
      most keenly, I might have given an answer worthier of me, and worthier of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped my hand, and sat by me in silence, thinking. Had I&mdash;without
      meaning it, God knows!&mdash;had I disappointed her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect me to tell my own sad story,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as frankly and as
      trustfully as you have told yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that! I know what an effort it was to you to answer me at
      all. Yes, indeed! I wonder whether I may ask something. The sorrow you
      have just told me of is not the only one&mdash;is it? You have had other
      troubles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when one can&rsquo;t help thinking of one&rsquo;s own
      miserable self. I try to be cheerful, but those times come now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and looked at me with a pale fear confessing itself in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know who Selina is?&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;My friend! The only friend I had,
      till you came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I guessed that she was speaking of the quaint, kindly little woman, whose
      ugly surname had been hitherto the only name known to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina has, I daresay, told you that I have been ill,&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;and that I am staying in the country for the benefit of my health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that she had something to say to me, far more important than
      this, and that she was dwelling on trifles to gain time and courage.
      Hoping to help her, I dwelt on trifles, too; asking commonplace questions
      about the part of the country in which she was staying. She answered
      absently&mdash;then, little by little, impatiently. The one poor proof of
      kindness that I could offer, now, was to say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what a strange creature I am?&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;Shall I make
      you angry with me? or shall I make you laugh at me? What I have shrunk
      from confessing to Selina&mdash;what I dare not confess to my father&mdash;I
      must, and will, confess to You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a look of horror in her face that alarmed me. I drew her to me
      so that she could rest her head on my shoulder. My own agitation
      threatened to get the better of me. For the first time since I had seen
      this sweet girl, I found myself thinking of the blood that ran in her
      veins, and of the nature of the mother who had borne her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice how I behaved upstairs?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mean when we left my
      father, and came out on the landing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was easily recollected; I begged her to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I went downstairs,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;you saw me look and listen.
      Did you think I was afraid of meeting some person? and did you guess who
      it was I wanted to avoid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed that&mdash;and I understood you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! You are not wicked enough to understand me. Will you do me a favor? I
      want you to look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was said seriously. She lifted her head for a moment, so that I could
      examine her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see anything,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;which makes you fear that I am not in
      my right mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! how can you ask such a horrible question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her head back on my shoulder with a sad little sigh of
      resignation. &ldquo;I ought to have known better,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;there is no such
      easy way out of it as that. Tell me&mdash;is there one kind of wickedness
      more deceitful than another? Can it be hid in a person for years together,
      and show itself when a time of suffering&mdash;no; I mean when a sense of
      injury comes? Did you ever see that, when you were master in the prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had seen it&mdash;and, after a moment&rsquo;s doubt, I said I had seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pity those poor wretches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! They deserved pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am one of them!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pity <i>me</i>. If Helena looks at me&mdash;if
      Helena speaks to me&mdash;if I only see Helena by accident&mdash;do you
      know what she does? She tempts me! Tempts me to do dreadful things! Tempts
      me&mdash;&rdquo; The poor child threw her arms round my neck, and whispered the
      next fatal words in my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother! Prepared as I was for the accursed discovery, the horror of it
      shook me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me, and started to her feet. The inherited energy showed itself
      in furious protest against the inherited evil. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll submit to anything. I&rsquo;ll bear my hard lot patiently, if you
      will only tell me what it means. Where does this horrid transformation of
      me out of myself come from? Look at my good father. In all this world
      there is no man so perfect as he is. And oh, how he has taught me! there
      isn&rsquo;t a single good thing that I have not learned from him since I was a
      little child. Did you ever hear him speak of my mother? You must have
      heard him. My mother was an angel. I could never be worthy of her at my
      best&mdash;but I have tried! I have tried! The wickedest girl in the world
      doesn&rsquo;t have worse thoughts than the thoughts that have come to me. Since
      when? Since Helena&mdash;oh, how can I call her by her name as if I still
      loved her? Since my sister&mdash;can she be my sister, I ask myself
      sometimes! Since my enemy&mdash;there&rsquo;s the word for her&mdash;since my
      enemy took Philip away from me. What does it mean? I have asked in my
      prayers&mdash;and have got no answer. I ask you. What does it mean? You
      must tell me! You shall tell me! What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did I not try to calm her? I had vainly tried to calm her&mdash;I who
      knew who her mother was, and what her mother had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, she had forced the sense of my duty on me. The simplest way of
      calming her was to put her back in the place by my side that she had left.
      It was useless to reason with her, it was impossible to answer her. I had
      my own idea of the one way in which I might charm Eunice back to her
      sweeter self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk of Philip,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fierce flush on her face softened, the swelling trouble of her bosom
      began to subside, as that dearly-loved name passed my lips! But there was
      some influence left in her which resisted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we had better not talk of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost all my courage. If you speak of Philip, you will make me
      cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew her nearer to me. If she had been my own child, I don&rsquo;t think I
      could have felt for her more truly than I felt at that moment. I only
      looked at her; I only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The love that was in her heart rose, and poured its tenderness into her
      eyes. I had longed to see the tears that would comfort her. The tears
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between us for a while. It was possible for me to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of physical resemblance between parent and child, is an
      unfavorable influence exercised on the tendency to moral resemblance?
      Assuming the possibility of such a result as this, Eunice (entirely unlike
      her mother) must, as I concluded, have been possessed of qualities formed
      to resist, as well as of qualities doomed to undergo, the infection of
      evil. While, therefore, I resigned myself to recognize the existence of
      the hereditary maternal taint, I firmly believed in the counterbalancing
      influences for good which had been part of the girl&rsquo;s birthright. They had
      been derived, perhaps, from the better qualities in her father&rsquo;s nature;
      they had been certainly developed by the tender care, the religious
      vigilance, which had guarded the adopted child so lovingly in the
      Minister&rsquo;s household; and they had served their purpose until time brought
      with it the change, for which the tranquil domestic influences were not
      prepared. With the great, the vital transformation, which marks the
      ripening of the girl into the woman&rsquo;s maturity of thought and passion, a
      new power for Good, strong enough to resist the latent power for Evil,
      sprang into being, and sheltered Eunice under the supremacy of Love. Love
      ill-fated and ill-bestowed&mdash;but love that no profanation could stain,
      that no hereditary evil could conquer&mdash;the True Love that had been,
      and was, and would be, the guardian angel of Eunice&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am asked whether I have ventured to found this opinion on what I have
      observed in one instance only, I reply that I have had other opportunities
      of investigation, and that my conclusions are derived from experience
      which refers to more instances than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man in his senses can doubt that physical qualities are transmitted
      from parents to children. But inheritance of moral qualities is less easy
      to trace. Here, the exploring mind finds its progress beset by obstacles.
      That those obstacles have been sometimes overcome I do not deny. Moral
      resemblances have been traced between parents and children. While,
      however, I admit this, I doubt the conclusion which sees, in inheritance
      of moral qualities, a positive influence exercised on moral destiny. There
      are inherent emotional forces in humanity to which the inherited
      influences must submit; they are essentially influences under control&mdash;influences
      which can be encountered and forced back. That we, who inhabit this little
      planet, may be the doomed creatures of fatality, from the cradle to the
      grave, I am not prepared to dispute. But I absolutely refuse to believe
      that it is a fatality with no higher origin than can be found in our
      accidental obligation to our fathers and mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still absorbed in these speculations, I was disturbed by a touch on my
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up. Eunice&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on a shrubbery, at some little
      distance from us, which closed the view of the garden on that side. I
      noticed that she was trembling. Nothing to alarm her was visible that I
      could discover. I asked what she had seen to startle her. She pointed to
      the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look again,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time I saw a woman&rsquo;s dress among the shrubs. The woman herself
      appeared in a moment more. It was Helena. She carried a small portfolio,
      and she approached us with a smile.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. THE WHISPERING VOICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I looked at Eunice. She had risen, startled by her first suspicion of the
      person who was approaching us through the shrubbery; but she kept her
      place near me, only changing her position so as to avoid confronting
      Helena. Her quickened breathing was all that told me of the effort she was
      making to preserve her self-control. Entirely free from unbecoming signs
      of hurry and agitation, Helena opened her business with me by means of an
      apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me for disturbing you. I am obliged to leave the house on one
      of my tiresome domestic errands. If you will kindly permit it, I wish to
      express, before I go, my very sincere regret for what I was rude enough to
      say, when I last had the honor of seeing you. May I hope to be forgiven?
      How-do-you-do, Eunice? Have you enjoyed your holiday in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eunice neither moved nor answered. Having some doubt of what might happen
      if the two girls remained together, I proposed to Helena to leave the
      garden and to let me hear what she had to say, in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite needless,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I shall not detain you for more than a
      minute. Please look at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She offered to me the portfolio that she had been carrying, and pointed to
      a morsel of paper attached to it, which contained this inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip&rsquo;s Letters To Me. Private. Helena Gracedieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a favor to ask,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and a proof of confidence in you to
      offer. Will you be so good as to look over what you find in my portfolio?
      I am unwilling to give up the hopes that I had founded on our interview,
      when I asked for it. The letters will, I venture to think, plead my cause
      more convincingly than I was able to plead it for myself. I wish to forget
      what passed between us, to the last word. To the last word,&rdquo; she repeated
      emphatically&mdash;with a look which sufficiently informed me that I had
      not been betrayed to her father yet. &ldquo;Will you indulge me?&rdquo; she asked, and
      offered her portfolio for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more impudent bargain could not well have been proposed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was to read, and to be favorably impressed by, Mr. Philip Dunboyne&rsquo;s
      letters; and Miss Helena was to say nothing of that unlucky slip of the
      tongue, relating to her mother, which she had discovered to be a serious
      act of self-betrayal&mdash;thanks to my confusion at the time. If I had
      not thought of Eunice, and of the desolate and loveless life to which the
      poor girl was so patiently resigned, I should have refused to read Miss
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s love-letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as things were, I was influenced by the hope (innocently encouraged
      by Eunice herself) that Philip Dunboyne might not be so wholly unworthy of
      the sweet girl whom he had injured as I had hitherto been too hastily
      disposed to believe. To act on this view with the purpose of promoting a
      reconciliation was impossible, unless I had the means of forming a correct
      estimate of the man&rsquo;s character. It seemed to me that I had found the
      means. A fair chance of putting his sincerity to a trustworthy test, was
      surely offered by the letters (the confidential letters) which I had been
      requested to read. To feel this as strongly as I felt it, brought me at
      once to a decision. I consented to take the portfolio&mdash;on my own
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand, Miss Helena,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I make no promises. I reserve my
      own opinion, and my own right of action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of your opinions or your actions,&rdquo; she answered
      confidently, &ldquo;if you will only read the letters. In the meantime, let me
      relieve my sister, there, of my presence. I hope you will soon recover,
      Eunice, in the country air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the object of the wretch was to exasperate her victim, she had
      completely failed. Eunice remained as still as a statue. To all
      appearance, she had not even heard what had been said to her. Helena
      looked at me, and touched her forehead with a significant smile. &ldquo;Sad,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said&mdash;and bowed, and went briskly away on her
      household errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Eunice never moved. I spoke to her, and produced no impression.
      Beginning to feel alarmed, I tried the effect of touching her. With a wild
      cry, she started into a state of animation. Almost at the same moment, she
      weakly swayed to and fro as if the pleasant breeze in the garden moved her
      at its will, like the flowers. I held her up, and led her to the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eunice&rsquo;s eyes rested on me in vacant surprise. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she
      asked. &ldquo;I hear her; but I never see her. Do you see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child! of what person are you speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;Of no person. I am speaking of a Voice that whispers and
      tempts me, when Helena is near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What voice, Eunice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whispering Voice. It said to me, &lsquo;I am your mother;&rsquo; it called me
      Daughter when I first heard it. My father speaks of my mother, the angel.
      That good spirit has never come to me from the better world. It is a
      mock-mother who comes to me&mdash;some spirit of evil. Listen to this. I
      was awake in my bed. In the dark I heard the mock-mother whispering, close
      at my ear. Shall I tell you how she answered me, when I longed for light
      to see her by, when I prayed to her to show herself to me? She said: &lsquo;My
      face was hidden when I passed from life to death; my face no mortal
      creature may see.&rsquo; I have never seen her&mdash;how can <i>you</i> have
      seen her? But I heard her again, just now. She whispered to me when Helena
      was standing there&mdash;where you are standing. She freezes the life in
      me. Did she freeze the life in <i>you?</i> Did you hear her tempting me?
      Don&rsquo;t speak of it, if you did. Oh, not a word! not a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man who has governed a prison may say with Macbeth, &ldquo;I have supped full
      with horrors.&rdquo; Hardened as I was&mdash;or ought to have been&mdash;the
      effect of what I had just heard turned me cold. If I had not known it to
      be absolutely impossible, I might have believed that the crime and the
      death of the murderess were known to Eunice, as being the crime and the
      death of her mother, and that the horrid discovery had turned her brain.
      This was simply impossible. What did it mean? Good God! what did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      My sense of my own helplessness was the first sense in me that recovered.
      I thought of Eunice&rsquo;s devoted little friend. A woman&rsquo;s sympathy seemed to
      be needed now. I rose to lead the way out of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina will think we are lost,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let us go and find Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t feel sure of myself. I might tell Selina something which
      she must never know; I should be so sorry to frighten her. Let me stop
      here with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I resumed my place at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her my hand. What composing influence this simple act may, or may
      not, have exercised, it is impossible to say. She was quiet, she was
      silent. After an interval, I heard her breathe a long-drawn sigh of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have surprised you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Helena brings the dreadful
      time back to me&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of Helena, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am afraid you will think&mdash;because I have said strange things&mdash;that
      I have been talking at random,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;The doctor will say that,
      if you meet with him. He believes I am deluded by a dream. I tried to
      think so myself. It was of no use; I am quite sure he is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I privately determined to watch for the doctor&rsquo;s arrival, and to consult
      with him. Eunice went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the story of a terrible night to tell you; but I haven&rsquo;t the
      courage to tell it now. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you come back with me to the place
      that I am staying at? A pleasant farm-house, and such kind people. You
      might read the account of that night in my journal. I shall not regret the
      misery of having written it, if it helps you to find out how this hateful
      second self of mine has come to me. Hush! I want to ask you something. Do
      you think Helena is in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;she has gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say that herself? Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She decided on going back to the farm, while Helena was out of the way. We
      left the garden together. For the first time, my companion noticed the
      portfolio. I happened to be carrying it in the hand that was nearest to
      her, as she walked by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was needless to reply in words. My hesitation spoke for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry it in your other hand,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;the hand that&rsquo;s furthest
      away from me. I don&rsquo;t want to see it! Do you mind waiting a moment while I
      find Selina? You will go to the farm with us, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to look over the letters, in Eunice&rsquo;s own interests; and I begged
      her to let me defer my visit to the farm until the next day. She
      consented, after making me promise to keep my appointment. It was of some
      importance to her, she told me, that I should make acquaintance with the
      farmer and his wife and children, and tell her how I liked them. Her plans
      for the future depended on what those good people might be willing to do.
      When she had recovered her health, it was impossible for her to go home
      again while Helena remained in the house. She had resolved to earn her own
      living, if she could get employment as a governess. The farmer&rsquo;s children
      liked her; she had already helped their mother in teaching them; and there
      was reason to hope that their father would see his way to employing her
      permanently. His house offered the great advantage of being near enough to
      the town to enable her to hear news of the Minister&rsquo;s progress toward
      recovery, and to see him herself when safe opportunities offered, from
      time to time. As for her salary, what did she care about money? Anything
      would be acceptable, if the good man would only realize her hopes for the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was disheartening to hear that hope, at her age, began and ended within
      such narrow limits as these. No prudent man would have tried to persuade
      her, as I now did, that the idea of reconciliation offered the better hope
      of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I see Mr. Philip Dunboyne when I go back to London,&rdquo; I began,
      &ldquo;what shall I say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I have forgiven him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that the blame really rests, where you all
      believe it to rest, with Helena. If that young man returns to you, truly
      ashamed of himself, truly penitent, will you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She resolutely interrupted me: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eunice, you surely mean Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me! Good-by till to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. THE QUAINT PHILOSOPHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No person came to my room, and nothing happened to interrupt me while I
      was reading Mr. Philip Dunboyne&rsquo;s letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, let me say at once, produced a very disagreeable impression
      on me. I have unexpectedly discovered Mrs. Tenbruggen&mdash;in a
      postscript. She is making a living as a Medical Rubber (or Masseuse), and
      is in professional attendance on Mr. Dunboyne the elder. More of this, a
      little further on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gone through the whole collection of young Dunboyne&rsquo;s letters, I
      set myself to review the differing conclusions which the correspondence
      had produced on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I call the papers submitted to me a correspondence, because the greater
      part of Philip&rsquo;s letters exhibit notes in pencil, evidently added by
      Helena. These express, for the most part, the interpretation which she had
      placed on passages that perplexed or displeased her; and they have, as
      Philip&rsquo;s rejoinders show, been employed as materials when she wrote her
      replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reflection, I find myself troubled by complexities and contradictions
      in the view presented of this young man&rsquo;s character. To decide positively
      whether I can justify to myself and to my regard for Eunice, an attempt to
      reunite the lovers, requires more time for consideration than I can
      reasonably expect that Helena&rsquo;s patience will allow. Having a quiet hour
      or two still before me, I have determined to make extracts from the
      letters for my own use; with the intention of referring to them while I am
      still in doubt which way my decision ought to incline. I shall present
      them here, to speak for themselves. Is there any objection to this? None
      that I can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, those extracts have a value of their own. They add
      necessary information to the present history of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, I am under no obligation to Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughter
      which forbids me to make use of her portfolio. I told her that I only
      consented to receive it, under reserve of my own right of action&mdash;and
      her assent to that stipulation was expressed in the clearest terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXTRACTS FROM MR. PHILIP DUNBOYNE&rsquo;S LETTERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Extract.
    </p>
    <p>
      You blame me, dear Helena, for not having paid proper attention to the
      questions put to me in your last letter. I have only been waiting to make
      up my mind, before I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      First question: Do I think it advisable that you should write to my
      father? No, my dear; I beg you will defer writing, until you hear from me
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second question: Considering that he is still a stranger to you, is there
      any harm in your asking me what sort of man my father is? No harm, my
      sweet one; but, as you will presently see, I am afraid you have addressed
      yourself to the wrong person.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father is kind, in his own odd way&mdash;and learned, and rich&mdash;a
      more high-minded and honorable man (as I have every reason to believe)
      doesn&rsquo;t live. But if you ask me which he prefers, his books or his son, I
      hope I do him no injustice when I answer, his books. His reading and his
      writing are obstacles between us which I have never been able to overcome.
      This is the more to be regretted because he is charming, on the few
      occasions when I find him disengaged. If you wish I knew more about my
      father, we are in complete agreement as usual&mdash;I wish, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a dear friend of yours and mine, who is just the person we
      want to help us. Need I say that I allude to Mrs. Staveley?
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on her yesterday, not long after she had paid a visit to my
      father. Luck had favored her. She arrived just at the time when hunger had
      obliged him to shut up his books, and ring for something to eat. Mrs.
      Staveley secured a favorable reception with her customary tact and
      delicacy. He had a fowl for his dinner. She knows his weakness of old; she
      volunteered to carve it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I can only repeat what this clever woman told me of their talk, you
      will have a portrait of Mr. Dunboyne the elder&mdash;not perhaps a
      highly-finished picture, but, as I hope and believe, a good likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley began by complaining to him of the conduct of his son. I had
      promised to write to her, and I had never kept my word. She had reasons
      for being especially interested in my plans and prospects, just then;
      knowing me to be attached (please take notice that I am quoting her own
      language) to a charming friend of hers, whom I had first met at her house.
      To aggravate the disappointment that I had inflicted, the young lady had
      neglected her, too. No letters, no information. Perhaps my father would
      kindly enlighten her? Was the affair going on? or was it broken off?
    </p>
    <p>
      My father held out his plate and asked for the other wing of the fowl. &ldquo;It
      isn&rsquo;t a bad one for London,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you have some yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to have interested you,&rdquo; Mrs. Staveley remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you expect me to be interested in?&rdquo; my father inquired. &ldquo;I was
      absorbed in the fowl. Favor me by returning to the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley admits that she answered this rather sharply: &ldquo;The subject,
      sir, was your son&rsquo;s admiration for a charming girl: one of the daughters
      of Mr. Gracedieu, the famous preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father is too well-bred to speak to a lady while his attention is
      absorbed by a fowl. He finished the second wing, and then he asked if
      &ldquo;Philip was engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite sure,&rdquo; Mrs. Staveley confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear friend, we will wait till we <i>are</i> sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Dunboyne, there is really no need to wait. I suppose your son
      comes here, now and then, to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is most attentive. In course of time he will contrive to hit on
      the right hour for his visit. At present, poor fellow, he interrupts me
      every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he hits upon the right time to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might ask him if he is engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. I think I might wait till Philip mentions it without asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary man you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no&mdash;only a philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This tried Mrs. Staveley&rsquo;s temper. You know what a perfectly candid person
      our friend is. She owned to me that she felt inclined to make herself
      disagreeable. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s thrown away upon me,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a
      philosopher is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let me pause for a moment, dear Helena. I have inexcusably forgotten to
      speak of my father&rsquo;s personal appearance. It won&rsquo;t take long. I need only
      notice one interesting feature which, so to speak, lifts his face out of
      the common. He has an eloquent nose. Persons possessing this rare
      advantage are blest with powers of expression not granted to their
      ordinary fellow-creatures. My father&rsquo;s nose is a mine of information to
      friends familiarly acquainted with it. It changes color like a modest
      young lady&rsquo;s cheek. It works flexibly from side to side like the rudder of
      a ship. On the present occasion, Mrs. Staveley saw it shift toward the
      left-hand side of his face. A sigh escaped the poor lady. Experience told
      her that my father was going to hold forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a philosopher is!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Be so kind as to
      look at me. I am a philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a philosopher, my charming friend, is a man who has discovered a
      system of life. Some systems assert themselves in volumes&mdash;<i>my</i>
      system asserts itself in two words: Never think of anything until you have
      first asked yourself if there is an absolute necessity for doing it, at
      that particular moment. Thinking of things, when things needn&rsquo;t be thought
      of, is offering an opportunity to Worry; and Worry is the favorite agent
      of Death when the destroyer handles his work in a lingering way, and
      achieves premature results. Never look back, and never look forward, as
      long as you can possibly help it. Looking back leads the way to sorrow.
      And looking forward ends in the cruelest of all delusions: it encourages
      hope. The present time is the precious time. Live for the passing day: the
      passing day is all that we can be sure of. You suggested, just now, that I
      should ask my son if he was engaged to be married. How do we know what
      wear and tear of your nervous texture I succeeded in saving when I said.
      &lsquo;Wait till Philip mentions it without asking?&rsquo; There is the personal
      application of my system. I have explained it in my time to every woman on
      the list of my acquaintance, including the female servants. Not one of
      them has rewarded me by adopting my system. How do you feel about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Staveley declined to tell me whether she had offered a bright example
      of gratitude to the rest of the sex. When I asked why, she declared that
      it was my turn now to tell her what I had been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will anticipate what followed. She objected to the mystery in which my
      prospects seemed to be involved. In plain English, was I, or was I not,
      engaged to marry her dear Eunice? I said, No. What else could I say? If I
      had told Mrs. Staveley the truth, when she insisted on my explaining
      myself, she would have gone back to my father, and would have appealed to
      his sense of justice to forbid our marriage. Finding me obstinately
      silent, she has decided on writing to Eunice. So we parted. But don&rsquo;t be
      disheartened. On my way out of the house, I met Mr. Staveley coming in,
      and had a little talk with him. He and his wife and his family are going
      to the seaside, next week. Mrs. Staveley once out of our way, I can tell
      my father of our engagement without any fear of consequences. If she
      writes to him, the moment he sees my name mentioned, and finds violent
      language associated with it, he will hand the letter to me. &ldquo;Your
      business, Philip: don&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rdquo; He will say that, and go back to
      his books. There is my father, painted to the life! Farewell, for the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      Remarks by H. G.&mdash;Philip&rsquo;s grace and gayety of style might be envied
      by any professional Author. He amuses me, but he rouses my suspicion at
      the same time. This slippery lover of mine tells me to defer writing to
      his father, and gives no reason for offering that strange advice to the
      young lady who is soon to be a member of the family. Is this merely one
      more instance of the weakness of his character? Or, now that he is away
      from my influence, is he beginning to regret Eunice already?
    </p>
    <p>
      Added by the Governor.&mdash;I too have my doubts. Is the flippant
      nonsense which Philip has written inspired by the effervescent good
      spirits of a happy young man? Or is it assumed for a purpose? In this
      latter case, I should gladly conclude that he was regarding his conduct to
      Eunice with becoming emotions of sorrow and shame.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. THE MASTERFUL MASSEUSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My next quotations will suffer a process of abridgment. I intend them to
      present the substance of three letters, reduced as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Extract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weak as he may be, Mr. Philip Dunboyne shows (in his second letter) that
      he can feel resentment, and that he can express his feelings, in replying
      to Miss Helena. He protests against suspicions which he has not deserved.
      That he does sometimes think of Eunice he sees no reason to deny. He is
      conscious of errors and misdeeds, which&mdash;traceable as they are to
      Helena&rsquo;s irresistible fascinations&mdash;may perhaps be considered rather
      his misfortune than his fault. Be that as it may, he does indeed feel
      anxious to hear good accounts of Eunice&rsquo;s health. If this honest avowal
      excites her sister&rsquo;s jealousy, he will be disappointed in Helena for the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      His third letter shows that this exhibition of spirit has had its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperious young lady regrets that she has hurt his feelings, and is
      rewarded for the apology by receiving news of the most gratifying kind.
      Faithful Philip has told his father that he is engaged to be married to
      Miss Helena Gracedieu, daughter of the celebrated Congregational preacher&mdash;and
      so on, and so on. Has Mr. Dunboyne the elder expressed any objection to
      the young lady? Certainly not! He knows nothing of the other engagement to
      Eunice; and he merely objects, on principle, to looking forward. &ldquo;How do
      we know,&rdquo; says the philosopher, &ldquo;what accidents may happen, or what doubts
      and hesitations may yet turn up? I am not to burden my mind in this
      matter, till I know that I must do it. Let me hear when she is ready to go
      to church, and I will be ready with the settlements. My compliments to
      Miss and her papa, and let us wait a little.&rdquo; Dearest Helena&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      he funny?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next letter has been already mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this there occurs the first startling reference to Mrs. Tenbruggen, by
      name. She is in London, finding her way to lucrative celebrity by
      twisting, turning, and pinching the flesh of credulous persons, afflicted
      with nervous disorders; and she has already paid a few medical visits to
      old Mr. Dunboyne. He persists in poring over his books while Mrs.
      Tenbruggen operates, sometimes on his cramped right hand, sometimes (in
      the fear that his brain may have something to do with it) on the back of
      his neck. One of them frowns over her rubbing, and the other frowns over
      his reading. It would be delightfully ridiculous, but for a drawback; Mr.
      Philip Dunboyne&rsquo;s first impressions of Mrs. Tenbruggen do not incline him
      to look at that lady from a humorous point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena&rsquo;s remarks follow, as usual. She has seen Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s name on
      the address of a letter written by Miss Jillgall&mdash;which is quite
      enough to condemn Mrs. Tenbruggen. As for Philip himself, she feels not
      quite sure of him, even yet. No more do I. Third Extract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter that follows must be permitted to speak for itself:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have flown into a passion, dearest Helena; and I am afraid I shall make
      you fly into a passion, too. Blame Mrs. Tenbruggen; don&rsquo;t blame me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first occasion when I found my father under the hands of the
      Medical Rubber, she took no notice of me. On the second occasion&mdash;when
      she had been in daily attendance on him for a week, at an exorbitant fee&mdash;she
      said in the coolest manner: &ldquo;Who is this young gentleman?&rdquo; My father laid
      down his book, for a moment only: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me again, ma&rsquo;am. The
      young gentleman is my son Philip.&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen eyed me with an
      appearance of interest which I was at a loss to account for. I hate an
      impudent woman. My visit came suddenly to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time I saw my father, he was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him how he got on with Mrs. Tenbruggen. As badly as possible, it
      appeared. &ldquo;She takes liberties with my neck; she interrupts me in my
      reading; and she does me no good. I shall end, Philip, in applying a
      medical rubbing to Mrs. Tenbruggen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, I found the masterful &ldquo;Masseuse&rdquo; torturing the poor old
      gentleman&rsquo;s muscles again. She had the audacity to say to me: &ldquo;Well, Mr.
      Philip, when are you going to marry Miss Eunice Gracedieu?&rdquo; My father
      looked up. &ldquo;Eunice?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;When my son told me he was engaged to
      Miss Gracedieu, he said &lsquo;Helena&rsquo;! Philip, what does this mean?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Tenbruggen was so obliging as to answer for me. &ldquo;Some mistake, sir; it&rsquo;s
      Eunice he is engaged to.&rdquo; I confess I forgot myself. &ldquo;How the devil do you
      know that?&rdquo; I burst out. Mrs. Tenbruggen ignored me and my language. &ldquo;I am
      sorry to see, sir, that your son&rsquo;s education has been neglected; he seems
      to be grossly ignorant of the laws of politeness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind the laws of
      politeness,&rdquo; says my father. &ldquo;You appear to be better acquainted with my
      son&rsquo;s matrimonial prospects than he is himself. How is that?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Tenbruggen favored him with another ready reply: &ldquo;My authority is a
      letter, addressed to me by a relative of Mr. Gracedieu&mdash;my dear and
      intimate friend, Miss Jillgall.&rdquo; My father&rsquo;s keen eyes traveled backward
      and forward between his female surgeon and his son. &ldquo;Which am I to
      believe?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I am surprised at your asking the question,&rdquo; I
      said. Mrs. Tenbruggen pointed to me. &ldquo;Look at Mr. Philip, sir&mdash;and
      you will allow him one merit. He is capable of showing it, when he knows
      he has disgraced himself.&rdquo; Without intending it, I am sure, my father
      infuriated me; he looked as if he believed her. Out came one of the
      smallest and strongest words in the English language before I could stop
      it: &ldquo;Mrs. Tenbruggen, you lie!&rdquo; The illustrious Rubber dropped my father&rsquo;s
      hand&mdash;she had been operating on him all the time&mdash;and showed us
      that she could assert her dignity when circumstances called for the
      exertion: &ldquo;Either your son or I, sir, must leave the room. Which is it to
      be?&rdquo; She met her match in my father. Walking quietly to the door, he
      opened it for Mrs. Tenbruggen with a low bow. She stopped on her way out,
      and delivered her parting words: &ldquo;Messieurs Dunboyne, father and son, I
      keep my temper, and merely regard you as a couple of blackguards.&rdquo; With
      that pretty assertion of her opinion, she left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were alone, there was but one course to take; I made my
      confession. It is impossible to tell you how my father received it&mdash;for
      he sat down at his library table with his back to me. The first thing he
      did was to ask me to help his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that the father of these girls was a parson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a Congregational Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the Minister think of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all; not another word could I extract from him. I don&rsquo;t pretend
      to have discovered what he really has in his mind. I only venture on a
      suggestion. If there is any old friend in your town, who has some
      influence over your father, leave no means untried of getting that friend
      to say a kind word for us. And then ask your father to write to mine. This
      is, as I see it, our only chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      There the letter ends. Helena&rsquo;s notes on it show that her pride is
      fiercely interested in securing Philip as a husband. Her victory over poor
      Eunice will, as she plainly intimates, be only complete when she is
      married to young Dunboyne. For the rest, her desperate resolution to win
      her way to my good graces is sufficiently intelligible, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own impressions vary. Philip rather gains upon me; he appears to have
      some capacity for feeling ashamed of himself. On the other hand, I regard
      the discovery of an intimate friendship existing between Mrs. Tenbruggen
      and Miss Jillgall with the gloomiest views. Is this formidable Masseuse
      likely to ply her trade in the country towns? And is it possible that she
      may come to this town? God forbid!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the other letters in the collection, I need take no special notice. I
      returned the whole correspondence to Helena, and waited to hear from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one recent event in Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s family, worthy of record, is of a
      melancholy nature. After paying his visit to-day, the doctor has left word
      that nobody but the nurse is to go near the Minister. This seems to
      indicate, but too surely, a change for the worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena has been away all the evening at the Girls&rsquo; School. She left a
      little note, informing me of her wishes: &ldquo;I shall expect to be favored
      with your decision to-morrow morning, in my housekeeping room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast time, the report of the poor Minister was still discouraging.
      I noticed that Helena was absent from the table. Miss Jillgall suspected
      that the cause was bad news from Mr. Philip Dunboyne, arriving by that
      morning&rsquo;s post. &ldquo;If you will excuse the use of strong language by a lady,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;Helena looked perfectly devilish when she opened the letter.
      She rushed away, and locked herself up in her own shabby room. A serious
      obstacle, as I suspect, in the way of her marriage. Cheering, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
       As usual, good Selina expressed her sentiments without reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to keep my appointment; and the sooner Helena Gracedieu and I
      understood each other the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked at the door. It was loudly unlocked, and violently thrown open.
      Helena&rsquo;s temper had risen to boiling heat; she stammered with rage when
      she spoke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to come to the point at once,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, Miss Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I count on your influence to help me? I want a positive answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her what she wanted. I said: &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a crumpled letter from her pocket, opened it, and smoothed it out
      on the table with a blow of her open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked. It was the letter addressed to Mr. Dunboyne the elder, which I
      had written for Mr. Gracedieu&mdash;with the one object of preventing
      Helena&rsquo;s marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I can depend on you to tell me the truth?&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without fear or favor,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you may depend on <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signature to the letter, Mr. Governor, is written by my father. But
      the letter itself is in a different hand. Do you, by any chance, recognize
      the writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose writing is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLIV. THE RESURRECTION OF THE PAST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After having identified my handwriting, I waited with some curiosity to
      see whether Helena would let her anger honestly show itself, or whether
      she would keep it down. She kept it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to return good for evil.&rdquo; (The evil was uppermost, nevertheless,
      when Miss Gracedieu expressed herself in these self-denying terms.) &ldquo;You
      are no doubt anxious to know if Philip&rsquo;s father has been won over to serve
      your purpose. Here is Philip&rsquo;s own account of it: the last of his letters
      that I shall trouble you to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked it over. The memorandum follows which I made for my own use:
    </p>
    <p>
      An eccentric philosopher is as capable as the most commonplace human being
      in existence of behaving like an honorable man. Mr. Dunboyne read the
      letter which bore the Minister&rsquo;s signature, and handed it to his son. &ldquo;Can
      you answer that?&rdquo; was all he said. Philip&rsquo;s silence confessed that he was
      unable to answer it&mdash;and Philip himself, I may add, rose accordingly
      in my estimation. His father pointed to the writing-desk. &ldquo;I must spare my
      cramped hand,&rdquo; the philosopher resumed, &ldquo;and I must answer Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      letter. Write, and leave a place for my signature.&rdquo; He began to dictate
      his reply. &ldquo;Sir&mdash;My son Philip has seen your letter, and has no
      defense to make. In this respect he has set an example of candor which I
      propose to follow. There is no excuse for him. What I can do to show that
      I feel for you, and agree with you, shall be done. At the age which this
      young man has reached, the laws of England abolish the authority of his
      father. If he is sufficiently infatuated to place his honor and his
      happiness at the mercy of a lady, who has behaved to her sister as your
      daughter has behaved to Miss Eunice, I warn the married couple not to
      expect a farthing of my money, either during my lifetime or after my
      death. Your faithful servant, DUNBOYNE, SENIOR.&rdquo; Having performed his duty
      as secretary, Philip received his dismissal: &ldquo;You may send my reply to the
      post,&rdquo; his father said; &ldquo;and you may keep Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s letter. Morally
      speaking, I regard that last document as a species of mirror, in which a
      young gentleman like yourself may see how ugly he looks.&rdquo; This, Philip
      declared, was his father&rsquo;s form of farewell. I handed back the letter to
      Helena. Not a word passed between us. In sinister silence she opened the
      door and left me alone in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mrs. Gracedieu and I had met in the bygone time, and&mdash;this was
      the only serious part of it&mdash;had met in secret, would now be made
      known to the Minister. Was I to blame for having shrunk from distressing
      my good friend, by telling him that his wife had privately consulted me on
      the means of removing his adopted child from his house? And, even if I had
      been cruel enough to do this, would he have believed my statement against
      the positive denial with which the woman whom he loved and trusted would
      have certainly met it? No! let the consequences of the coming disclosure
      be what they might, I failed to see any valid reason for regretting my
      conduct in the past time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Miss Jillgall waiting in the passage to see me come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could tell her what had happened, there was a ring at the
      house-bell. The visitor proved to be Mr. Wellwood, the doctor. I was
      anxious to speak to him on the subject of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s health. Miss
      Jillgall introduced me, as an old and dear friend of the Minister, and
      left us together in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I think of Mr. Gracedieu?&rdquo; he said, repeating the first question
      that I put. &ldquo;Well, sir, I think badly of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Entering into details, after that ominous reply, Mr. Wellwood did not
      hesitate to say that his patient&rsquo;s nerves were completely shattered.
      Disease of the brain had, as he feared, been already set up. &ldquo;As to the
      causes which have produced this lamentable break-down,&rdquo; the doctor
      continued, &ldquo;Mr. Gracedieu has been in the habit of preaching extempore
      twice a day on Sundays, and sometimes in the week as well&mdash;and has
      uniformly refused to spare himself when he was in most urgent need of
      rest. If you have ever attended his chapel, you have seen a man in a state
      of fiery enthusiasm, feeling intensely every word that he utters. Think of
      such exhaustion as that implies going on for years together, and
      accumulating its wasting influences on a sensitively organized
      constitution. Add that he is tormented by personal anxieties, which he
      confesses to no one, not even to his own children and the sum of it all is
      that a worse case of its kind, I am grieved to say, has never occurred in
      my experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the doctor left me to go to his patient, I asked leave to occupy a
      minute more of his time. My object was, of course, to speak about Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change of subject seemed to be agreeable to Mr. Wellwood. He smiled
      good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need feel no alarm about the health of that interesting girl,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;When she complained to me&mdash;at her age!&mdash;of not being able
      to sleep, I should have taken it more seriously if I had been told that
      she too had her troubles, poor little soul. Love-troubles, most likely&mdash;but
      don&rsquo;t forget that my professional limits keep me in the dark! Have you
      heard that she took some composing medicine, which I had prescribed for
      her father? The effect (certain, in any case, to be injurious to a young
      girl) was considerably aggravated by the state of her mind at the time. A
      dream that frightened her, and something resembling delirium, seems to
      have followed. And she made matters worse, poor child, by writing in her
      diary about the visions and supernatural appearances that had terrified
      her. I was afraid of fever, on the day when they first sent for me. We
      escaped that complication, and I was at liberty to try the best of all
      remedies&mdash;quiet and change of air. I have no fears for Miss Eunice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that cheering reply he went up to the Minister&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that I had found perplexing in Eunice was now made clear. I understood
      how her agony at the loss of her lover, and her keen sense of the wrong
      that she had suffered, had been strengthened in their disastrous influence
      by her experiment on the sleeping draught intended for her father. In mind
      and body, both, the poor girl was in the condition which offered its
      opportunity to the lurking hereditary taint. It was terrible to think of
      what might have happened, if the all-powerful counter-influence had not
      been present to save her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had been long alone the servant-maid came in, and said the doctor
      wanted to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wellwood was waiting in the passage, outside the Minister&rsquo;s
      bedchamber. He asked if he could speak to me without interruption, and
      without the fear of being overheard. I led him at once to the room which I
      occupied as a guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the very time when it is most important to keep Mr. Gracedieu quiet,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;something has happened to excite&mdash;I might almost say to
      infuriate him. He has left his bed, and is walking up and down the room;
      and, I don&rsquo;t scruple to say, he is on the verge of madness. He insists on
      seeing you. Being wholly unable to control him in any other way, I have
      consented to this. But I must not allow you to place yourself in what may
      be a disagreeable position, without a word of warning. Judging by his
      tones and his looks, he seems to have no very friendly motive for wishing
      to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Knowing perfectly well what had happened, and being one of those impatient
      people who can never endure suspense&mdash;I offered to go at once to Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s room. The doctor asked leave to say one word more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray be careful that you neither say nor do anything to thwart him,&rdquo; Mr.
      Wellwood resumed. &ldquo;If he expresses an opinion, agree with him. If he is
      insolent and overbearing, don&rsquo;t answer him. In the state of his brain, the
      one hopeful course to take is to let him have his own way. Pray remember
      that. I will be within call, in case of your wanting me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. THE FATAL PORTRAIT.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I knocked at the bedroom door.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only two words&mdash;but the voice that uttered them, hoarse and
      peremptory, was altered almost beyond recognition. If I had not known
      whose room it was, I might have doubted whether the Minister had really
      spoken to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the instant when I answered him, I was allowed to pass in. Having
      admitted me, he closed the door, and placed himself with his back against
      it. The customary pallor of his face had darkened to a deep red; there was
      an expression of ferocious mockery in his eyes. Helena&rsquo;s vengeance had
      hurt her unhappy father far more severely than it seemed likely to hurt
      me. The doctor had said he was on the verge of madness. To my thinking, he
      had already passed the boundary line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received me with a boisterous affectation of cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My excellent friend! My admirable, honorable, welcome guest, you don&rsquo;t
      know how glad I am to see you. Stand a little nearer to the light; I want
      to admire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the doctor&rsquo;s advice, I obeyed him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you were a handsome fellow when I first knew you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you
      have some remains of it still left. Do you remember the time when you were
      a favorite with the ladies? Oh, don&rsquo;t pretend to be modest; don&rsquo;t turn
      your back, now you are old, on what you were in the prime of your life. Do
      you own that I am right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What his object might be in saying this&mdash;if, indeed, he had an object&mdash;it
      was impossible to guess. The doctor&rsquo;s advice left me no alternative; I
      hastened to own that he was right. As I made that answer, I observed that
      he held something in his hand which was half hidden up the sleeve of his
      dressing-gown. What the nature of the object was I failed to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I happened to speak of you somewhere,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I forget
      where&mdash;a member of my congregation&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recollect who it was&mdash;told
      me you were connected with the aristocracy. How were you connected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He surprised me; but, however he had got his information, he had not been
      deceived. I told him that I was connected, through my mother, with the
      family to which he had alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The aristocracy!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;A race of people who are rich without
      earning their money, and noble because their great-grandfathers were noble
      before them. They live in idleness and luxury&mdash;profligates who
      gratify their passions without shame and without remorse. Deny, if you
      dare, that this is a true description of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really pitiable. Heartily sorry for him, I pacified him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t suppose I forget that you are one of them. Do you hear me, my
      noble friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it&mdash;I made another conciliatory reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain of you. You have not attempted to
      deceive me&mdash;yet. Absolute silence is what I require next. Though you
      may not suspect it, my mind is in a ferment; I must try to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To some extent at least, his thoughts betrayed themselves in his actions.
      He put the object that I had half seen in his hand into the pocket of his
      dressing-gown, and moved to the toilet-table. Opening one of the drawers,
      he took from it a folded sheet of paper, and came back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minister of the Gospel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a sacred man, and has a horror of
      crime. You are safe, so far&mdash;provided you obey me. I have a solemn
      and terrible duty to perform. This is not the right place for it. Follow
      me downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out. The doctor, waiting in the passage, was not near the
      stairs, and so escaped notice. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Mr. Wellwood whispered. In
      the same guarded way, I said: &ldquo;He has not told me yet; I have been careful
      not to irritate him.&rdquo; When we descended the stairs, the doctor followed us
      at a safe distance. He mended his pace when the Minister opened the door
      of the study, and when he saw us both pass in. Before he could follow, the
      door was closed and locked in his face. Mr. Gracedieu took out the key and
      threw it through the open window, into the garden below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning back into the room, he laid the folded sheet of paper on the
      table. That done, he spoke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I distrust my own weakness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A dreadful necessity confronts me&mdash;I
      might shrink from the horrid idea, and, if I could open the door, might
      try to get away. Escape is impossible now. We are prisoners together. But
      don&rsquo;t suppose that we are alone. There is a third person present, who will
      judge between you and me. Look there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed solemnly to the portrait of his wife. It was a small picture,
      very simply framed; representing the face in a &ldquo;three-quarter&rdquo; view, and
      part of the figure only. As a work of art it was contemptible; but, as a
      likeness, it answered its purpose. My unhappy friend stood before it, in
      an attitude of dejection, covering his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interval of silence that followed, I was reminded that an unseen
      friend was keeping watch outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by having heard the key turned in the lock, and realizing the
      embarrassment of the position in which I was placed, the doctor had
      discovered a discreet way of communicating with me. He slipped one of his
      visiting-cards under the door, with these words written on it: &ldquo;How can I
      help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the pencil from my pocketbook, and wrote on the blank side of the
      card: &ldquo;He has thrown the key into the garden; look for it under the
      window.&rdquo; A glance at the Minister, before I returned my reply, showed that
      his attitude was unchanged. Without being seen or suspected, I, in my
      turn, slipped the card under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow minutes followed each other&mdash;and still nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      My anxiety to see how the doctor&rsquo;s search for the key was succeeding,
      tempted me to approach the window. On my way to it, the tail of my coat
      threw down a little tray containing pens and pencils, which had been left
      close to the edge of the table. Slight as the noise of the fall was, it
      disturbed Mr. Gracedieu. He looked round vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been comforted by prayer,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;The weakness of poor
      humanity has found strength in the Lord.&rdquo; He pointed to the portrait once
      more: &ldquo;My hands must not presume to touch it, while I am still in doubt.
      Take it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I removed the picture and placed it, by his directions, on a chair that
      stood midway between us. To my surprise his tones faltered; I saw tears
      rising in his eyes. &ldquo;You may think you see a picture there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      are wrong. You see my wife herself. Stand here, and look at my wife with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood together, with our eyes fixed on the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without anything said or done on my part to irritate him, he suddenly
      turned to me in a state of furious rage. &ldquo;Not a sign of sorrow!&rdquo; he burst
      out. &ldquo;Not a blush of shame! Wretch, you stand condemned by the atrocious
      composure that I see in your face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A first discovery of the odious suspicion of which I was the object,
      dawned on my mind at that moment. My capacity for restraining myself
      completely failed me. I spoke to him as if he had been an accountable
      being. &ldquo;Once for all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me what I have a right to know. You
      suspect me of something. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of directly replying, he seized my arm and led me to the table.
      &ldquo;Take up that paper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is writing on it. Read&mdash;and let
      Her judge between us. Your life depends on how you answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there a weapon concealed in the room? or had he got it in the pocket
      of his dressing-gown? I listened for the sound of the doctor&rsquo;s returning
      footsteps in the passage outside, and heard nothing. My life had once
      depended, years since, on my success in heading the arrest of an escaped
      prisoner. I was not conscious, then, of feeling my energies weakened by
      fear. But <i>that</i> man was not mad; and I was younger, in those days,
      by a good twenty years or more. At my later time of life, I could show my
      old friend that I was not afraid of him&mdash;but I was conscious of an
      effort in doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the paper. &ldquo;Am I to read this to myself?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Or am I to
      read it aloud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it aloud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In these terms, his daughter addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so unfortunate, dearest father, as to displease you, and I
      dare not hope that you will consent to receive me. What it is my painful
      duty to tell you, must be told in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grieved as I am to distress you, in your present state of health, I must
      not hesitate to reveal what it has been my misfortune&mdash;I may even say
      my misery, when I think of my mother&mdash;to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me make sure, in such a serious matter as this is, that I am not
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those happy past days, when I was still dear to my father, you said
      you thought of writing to invite a dearly-valued friend to pay a visit to
      this house. You had first known him, as I understood, when my mother was
      still living. Many interesting things you told me about this old friend,
      but you never mentioned that he knew, or that he had even seen, my mother.
      I was left to suppose that those two had remained strangers to each other
      to the day of her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any misinterpretation here of what you said, or perhaps of
      what you meant to say, pray destroy what I have written without turning to
      the next page; and forgive me for having innocently startled you by a
      false alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gracedieu interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wait till you have got to the end&mdash;I
      shall question you now. Give me the paper; it will help me to keep this
      mystery of iniquity clear in my own mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated&mdash;and looked at the portrait once more. &ldquo;Turn her away
      from me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t face my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I placed the picture with its back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He consulted the paper, reading it with but little of the confusion and
      hesitation which my experience of him had induced me to anticipate. Had
      the mad excitement that possessed him exercised an influence in clearing
      his mind, resembling in some degree the influence exercised by a storm in
      clearing the air? Whatever the right explanation may be, I can only report
      what I saw. I could hardly have mastered what his daughter had written
      more readily, if I had been reading it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helena tells me,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that you said you knew her by her likeness
      to her mother. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you made an excuse for leaving her&mdash;see! here it is, written
      down. You made an excuse, and left her when she asked for an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He consulted the paper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter says&mdash;No! I won&rsquo;t be hurried and I won&rsquo;t be interrupted&mdash;she
      says you were confused. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so. Let your questions wait for a moment. I wish to tell you why I
      was confused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I said I won&rsquo;t be interrupted? Do you think you can shake <i>my</i>
      resolution?&rdquo; He referred to the paper again. &ldquo;I have lost the place. It&rsquo;s
      your fault&mdash;find it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evidence which was intended to convict me was the evidence which I was
      expected to find! I pointed it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His natural courtesy asserted itself in spite of his anger. He said &ldquo;Thank
      you,&rdquo; and questioned me the moment after as fiercely as ever. &ldquo;Go back to
      the time, sir, when we met in your rooms at the prison. Did you know my
      wife then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you and she see each other&mdash;ha! I&rsquo;ve got it now&mdash;did you
      see each other after I had left the town? No prevarication! You own to
      telling Helena that you knew her by her likeness to her mother. You must
      have seen her mother. Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made another effort to defend myself. He again refused furiously to hear
      me. It was useless to persist. Whatever the danger that threatened me
      might be, the sooner it showed itself the easier I should feel. I told him
      that Mrs. Gracedieu had called on me, after he and his wife had left the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that she came to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that answer, he no longer required the paper to help him. He threw
      it from him on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you received her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without inquiring whether I knew of her
      visit or not? Guilty deception on your part&mdash;guilty deception on her
      part. Oh, the hideous wickedness of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his mad suspicion that I had been his wife&rsquo;s lover betrayed itself in
      this way, I made a last attempt, in the face of my own conviction that it
      was hopeless, to place my conduct and his wife&rsquo;s conduct before him in the
      true light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gracedieu&rsquo;s object was to consult me&mdash;&rdquo; Before I could say the
      next words, I saw him put his hand into the pocket of his dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An innocent man,&rdquo; he sternly declared, &ldquo;would have told me that my wife
      had been to see him&mdash;you kept it a secret. An innocent woman would
      have given me a reason for wishing to go to you&mdash;she kept it a
      secret, when she left my house; she kept it a secret when she came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gracedieu, I insist on being heard! Your wife&rsquo;s motive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his pocket the thing that he had hidden from me. This time,
      there was no concealment; he let me see that he was opening a razor. It
      was no time for asserting my innocence; I had to think of preserving my
      life. When a man is without firearms, what defense can avail against a
      razor in the hands of a madman? A chair was at my side; it offered the one
      poor means of guarding myself that I could see. I laid my hand on it, and
      kept my eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, looking backward and forward between the picture and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of them shall I kill first?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;The man who was
      my trusted friend? Or the woman whom I believed to be an angel on earth?&rdquo;
       He stopped once more, in a state of fierce self-concentration, debating
      what he should do. &ldquo;The woman,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Wretch! Fiend! Harlot! How I
      loved her!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a yell of fury, he pounced on the picture&mdash;ripped the canvas out
      of the frame&mdash;and cut it malignantly into fragments. As they dropped
      from the razor on the floor, he stamped on them, and ground them under his
      foot. &ldquo;Go, wife of my bosom,&rdquo; he cried, with a dreadful mockery of voice
      and look&mdash;&ldquo;go, and burn everlastingly in the place of torment!&rdquo; His
      eyes glared at me. &ldquo;Your turn now,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and rushed at me with
      his weapon ready in his hand. I hurled the chair at his right arm. The
      razor dropped on the floor. I caught him by the wrist. Like a wild animal
      he tried to bite me. With my free hand&mdash;if I had known how to defend
      myself in any other way, I would have taken that way&mdash;with my free
      hand I seized him by the throat; forced him back; and held him against the
      wall. My grasp on his throat kept him quiet. But the dread of seriously
      injuring him so completely overcame me, that I forgot I was a prisoner in
      the room, and was on the point of alarming the household by a cry for
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still struggling to preserve my self-control, when the sound of
      footsteps broke the silence outside. I heard the key turn in the lock, and
      saw the doctor at the open door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. THE CUMBERSOME LADIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I cannot prevail upon myself to dwell at any length on the events that
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We secured my unhappy friend, and carried him to his bed. It was necessary
      to have men in attendance who could perform the duty of watching him. The
      doctor sent for them, while I went downstairs to make the best I could of
      the miserable news which it was impossible entirely to conceal. All that I
      could do to spare Miss Jillgall, I did. I was obliged to acknowledge that
      there had been an outbreak of violence, and that the portrait of the
      Minister&rsquo;s wife had been destroyed by the Minister himself. Of Helena&rsquo;s
      revenge on me I said nothing. It had led to consequences which even her
      merciless malice could not have contemplated. There were no obstacles in
      the way of keeping secret the attempt on my life. But I was compelled to
      own that Mr. Gracedieu had taken a dislike to me, which rendered it
      necessary that my visit should be brought to an end. I hastened to add
      that I should go to the hotel, and should wait there until the next day,
      in the hope of hearing better news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the multitude of questions with which poor Miss Jillgall overwhelmed me&mdash;of
      the wild words of sorrow and alarm that escaped her&mdash;of the desperate
      manner in which she held by my arm, and implored me not to go away, when I
      must see for myself that &ldquo;she was a person entirely destitute of presence
      of mind&rdquo;&mdash;I shall say nothing. The undeserved suffering that is
      inflicted on innocent persons by the sins of others demands silent
      sympathy; and, to that extent at least, I can say that I honestly felt for
      my quaint and pleasant little friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the doctor called on me at the hotel. The medical treatment
      of his patient had succeeded in calming the maddened brain under the
      influence of sleep. If the night passed quietly, better news might be
      hoped for in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day I had arranged to drive to the farm, being resolved not to
      disappoint Eunice. But I shrank from the prospect of having to distress
      her as I had already distressed Miss Jillgall. The only alternative left
      was to repeat the sad story in writing, subject to the concealments which
      I had already observed. This I did, and sent the letter by messenger,
      overnight, so that Eunice might know when to expect me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical report, in the morning, justified some hope. Mr. Gracedieu had
      slept well, and there had been no reappearance of insane violence on his
      waking. But the doctor&rsquo;s opinion was far from encouraging when we spoke of
      the future. He did not anticipate the cruel necessity of placing the
      Minister under restraint&mdash;unless some new provocation led to a new
      outbreak. The misfortune to be feared was imbecility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just leaving the hotel to keep my appointment with Eunice, when the
      waiter announced the arrival of a young lady who wished to speak with me.
      Before I could ask if she had mentioned her name, the young lady herself
      walked in&mdash;Helena Gracedieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained her object in calling on me, with the exasperating composure
      which was peculiarly her own. No parallel to it occurs to me in my
      official experience of shameless women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to speak of what happened yesterday, so far as I know
      anything about it,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;It is quite enough for me that you have
      been obliged to leave the house and to take refuge in this hotel. I have
      come to say a word about the future. Are you honoring me with your
      attention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I signed to her to go on. If I had answered in words, I should have told
      her to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;I thought of writing; but it occurred to me that
      you might keep my letter, and show it to Philip, by way of lowering me in
      his good opinion, as you have lowered me in the good opinion of his
      father. My object in coming here is to give you a word of warning. If you
      attempt to make mischief next between Philip and myself, I shall hear of
      it&mdash;and you know what to expect, when you have me for an enemy. It is
      not worth while to say any more. We understand each other, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was determined to have a reply&mdash;and she got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite yet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have been hitherto, as becomes a gentleman,
      always mindful of a woman&rsquo;s claims to forbearance. You will do well not to
      tempt me into forgetting that <i>you</i> are a woman, by prolonging your
      visit. Now, Miss Helena Gracedieu, we understand each other.&rdquo; She made me
      a low curtsey, and answered in her finest tone of irony: &ldquo;I only desire to
      wish you a pleasant journey home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rang for the waiter. &ldquo;Show this lady out,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this failed to have the slightest effect on her. She sauntered to the
      door, as perfectly at her ease as if the room had been hers&mdash;not
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had thought of driving to the farm. Shall I confess it? My temper was so
      completely upset that active movement of some kind offered the one means
      of relief in which I could find refuge. The farm was not more than five
      miles distant, and I had been a good walker all my life. After making the
      needful inquiries, I set forth to visit Eunice on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      My way through the town led me past the Minister&rsquo;s house. I had left the
      door some fifty yards behind me, when I saw two ladies approaching. They
      were walking, in the friendliest manner, arm in arm. As they came nearer,
      I discovered Miss Jillgall. Her companion was the middle-aged lady who had
      declined to give her name, when we met accidentally at Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hysterically impulsive, Miss Jillgall seized both my hands, and
      overwhelmed me with entreaties that I would go back with her to the house.
      I listened rather absently. The middle-aged lady happened to be nearer to
      me now than on either of the former occasions on which I had seen her.
      There was something in the expression of her eyes which seemed to be
      familiar to me. But the effort of my memory was not helped by what I
      observed in the other parts of her face. The iron-gray hair, the baggy
      lower eyelids, the fat cheeks, the coarse complexion, and the double chin,
      were features, and very disagreeable features, too, which I had never seen
      at any former time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do pray come back with us,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall pleaded. &ldquo;We were just talking
      of you. I and my friend&mdash;&rdquo; There she stopped, evidently on the point
      of blurting out the name which she had been forbidden to utter in my
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady smiled; her provokingly familiar eyes rested on me with a
      humorous enjoyment of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said to Miss Jillgall, &ldquo;caution ceases to be a virtue when
      it ceases to be of any use. The Governor is beginning to remember me, and
      the inevitable recognition&mdash;with <i>his</i> quickness of perception&mdash;is
      likely to be a matter of minutes now.&rdquo; She turned to me. &ldquo;In more ways
      than one, sir, women are hardly used by Nature. As they advance in years
      they lose more in personal appearance than the men do. You are
      white-haired, and (pray excuse me) you are too fat; and (allow me to take
      another liberty) you stoop at the shoulders&mdash;but you have not
      entirely lost your good looks. <i>I</i> am no longer recognizable. Allow
      me to prompt you, as they say on the stage. I am Mrs. Tenbruggen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a man of the world, I ought to have been capable of concealing my
      astonishment and dismay. She struck me dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen in the town! The one woman whose appearance Mr. Gracedieu
      had dreaded, and justly dreaded, stood before me&mdash;free, as a friend
      of his kinswoman, to enter his house, at the very time when he was a
      helpless man, guarded by watchers at his bedside. My first clear idea was
      to get away from both the women, and consider what was to be done next. I
      bowed&mdash;and begged to be excused&mdash;and said I was in a hurry, all
      in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this, the best of genial old maids was unable to restrain her
      curiosity. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too confused to think of an excuse, I said I was going to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see my dear Euneece?&rdquo; Miss Jillgall burst out. &ldquo;Oh, we will go with
      you!&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s politeness added immediately, &ldquo;With the greatest
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. THE JOURNEY TO THE FARM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My first ungrateful impulse was to get rid of the two cumbersome ladies
      who had offered to be my companions. It was needless to call upon my
      invention for an excuse; the truth, as I gladly perceived, would serve my
      purpose. I had only to tell them that I had arranged to walk to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lean, wiry, and impetuous, Miss Jillgall received my excuse with the
      sincerest approval of it, as a new idea. &ldquo;Nothing could be more agreeable
      to me,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;I have been a wonderful walker all my life.&rdquo; She
      turned to her friend. &ldquo;We will go with him, my dear, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s reception of this proposal inspired me with hope; she
      asked how far it was to the farm. &ldquo;Five miles!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And five
      miles back again, unless the farmer lends us a cart. My dear Selina, you
      might as well ask me to walk to the North Pole. You have got rid of one of
      us, Mr. Governor,&rdquo; she added, pleasantly; &ldquo;and the other, if you only walk
      fast enough, you will leave behind you on the road. If I believed in luck&mdash;which
      I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I should call you a fortunate man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But companionable Selina would not hear of a separation. She asked, in her
      most irresistible manner, if I objected to driving instead of walking. Her
      heart&rsquo;s dearest wish, she said, was to make her bosom friend and myself
      better acquainted with each other. To conclude, she reminded me that there
      was a cab-stand in the next street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I might have been influenced by my distrust of Mrs. Tenbruggen, or
      perhaps by my anxiety to protect Eunice. It struck me that I might warn
      the defenseless girl to be on her guard with Mrs. Tenbruggen to better
      purpose, if Eunice was in a position to recognize her in any future
      emergency that might occur. To my mind, this dangerous woman was doubly
      formidable&mdash;and for a good reason; she was the bosom friend of that
      innocent and unwary person, Miss Jillgall. So I amiably consented to
      forego my walk, yielding to the superior attraction of Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s
      company. On that day the sunshine was tempered by a delightful breeze. If
      we had been in the biggest and worst-governed city on the civilised earth,
      we should have found no public vehicle, open to the air, which could offer
      accommodation to three people. Being only in a country town, we had a
      light four-wheeled chaise at our disposal, as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wise man expects to be mercifully treated, when he is shut into a
      carriage with a mature single lady, inflamed by curiosity. I was not
      unprepared for Miss Jillgall when she alluded, for the second time, to the
      sad events which had happened in the house on the previous day&mdash;and
      especially to the destruction by Mr. Gracedieu of the portrait of his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he destroy something else?&rdquo; she pleaded, piteously. &ldquo;It is
      such a disappointment to Me. I never liked that picture myself. Of course
      I ought to have admired the portrait of the wife of my benefactor. But no&mdash;that
      disagreeable painted face was too much for me. I should have felt
      inexpressibly relieved, if I could have shown it to Elizabeth, and heard
      her say that she agreed with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I saw it when I called on you,&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen suggested. &ldquo;Where
      did the picture hang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! I received you in the dining-room, and the portrait hung in Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What they said to each other next escaped my attention. Quite
      unconsciously, Miss Jillgall had revealed to me a danger which neither the
      Minister nor I had discovered, though it had conspicuously threatened us
      both on the wall of the study. The act of mad destruction which, if I had
      possessed the means of safely interfering, I should certainly have
      endeavored to prevent, now assumed a new and startling aspect. If Mrs.
      Tenbruggen really had some motive of her own for endeavoring to identify
      the adopted child, the preservation of the picture must have led her
      straight to the end in view. The most casual opportunity of comparing
      Helena with the portrait of Mrs. Gracedieu would have revealed the
      likeness between mother and daughter&mdash;and, that result attained, the
      identification of Eunice with the infant whom the &ldquo;Miss Chance&rdquo; of those
      days had brought to the prison must inevitably have followed. It was
      perhaps natural that Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s infatuated devotion to the memory of
      his wife should have blinded him to the betrayal of Helena&rsquo;s parentage,
      which met his eyes every time he entered his study. But that I should have
      been too stupid to discover what he had failed to see, was a wound dealt
      to my self-esteem which I was vain enough to feel acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s voice, cheery and humorous, broke in on my reflections,
      with an odd question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Governor, do you ever condescend to read novels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to say, Mrs. Tenbruggen, how grateful I am to the writers
      of novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I read novels, too. But I blush to confess&mdash;do I blush?&mdash;that
      I never thought of feeling grateful till you mentioned it. Selina and I
      don&rsquo;t complain of your preferring your own reflections to our company. On
      the contrary, you have reminded us agreeably of the heroes of fiction,
      when the author describes them as being &lsquo;absorbed in thought.&rsquo; For some
      minutes, Mr. Governor, you have been a hero; absorbed, as I venture to
      guess, in unpleasant remembrances of the time when I was a single lady.
      You have not forgotten how badly I behaved, and what shocking things I
      said, in those bygone days. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are entirely wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that I may have spoken a little too sharply. Anyway,
      faithful Selina interceded for her friend. &ldquo;Oh, dear sir, don&rsquo;t be hard on
      Elizabeth! She always means well.&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen, as facetious as ever,
      made a grateful return for a small compliment. She chucked Miss Jillgall
      under the chin, with the air of an amorous old gentleman expressing his
      approval of a pretty servant-girl. It was impossible to look at the two,
      in their relative situations, without laughing. But Mrs. Tenbruggen failed
      to cheat me into altering my opinion of her. Innocent Miss Jillgall
      clapped her ugly hands, and said: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she good company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s social resources were not exhausted yet. She suddenly
      shifted to the serious side of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have improved a little,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as I have advanced in
      years. The sorrows of an unhappy married life may have had a purifying
      influence on my nature. My husband and I began badly. Mr. Tenbruggen
      thought I had money; and I thought Mr. Tenbruggen had money. He was taken
      in by me; and I was taken in by him. When he repeated the words of the
      marriage service (most impressively read by your friend the Chaplain):
      &lsquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow&rsquo;&mdash;his eloquent voice
      suggested one of the largest incomes in Europe. When I promised and vowed,
      in my turn, the delightful prospect of squandering my rich husband&rsquo;s money
      made quite a new woman of me. I declare solemnly, when I said I would
      love, honor, and obey Mr. T., I looked as if I really meant it. Wherever
      he is now, poor dear, he is cheating somebody. Such a handsome,
      gentleman-like man, Selina! And, oh, Mr. Governor, such a blackguard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having described her husband in those terms, she got tired of the subject.
      We were now favored with another view of this many-sided woman. She
      appeared in her professional character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a delicious breeze is blowing, out here in the country!&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Will you excuse me if I take off my gloves? I want to air my
      hands.&rdquo; She held up her hands to the breeze; firm, muscular, deadly white
      hands. &ldquo;In my professional occupation,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;I am always
      rubbing, tickling, squeezing, tapping, kneading, rolling, striking the
      muscles of patients. Selina, do you know the movements of your own joints?
      Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, circumduction,
      pronation, supination, and the lateral movements. Be proud of those
      accomplishments, my dear, but beware of attempting to become a Masseuse.
      There are drawbacks in that vocation&mdash;and I am conscious of one of
      them at this moment.&rdquo; She lifted her hands to her nose. &ldquo;Pah! my hands
      smell of other people&rsquo;s flesh. The delicious country air will blow it away&mdash;the
      luxury of purification!&rdquo; Her fingers twisted and quivered, and got crooked
      at one moment and straight again at another, and showed themselves in
      succession singly, and flew into each other fiercely interlaced, and then
      spread out again like the sticks of a fan, until it really made me giddy
      to look at them. As for Miss Jillgall, she lifted her poor little sunken
      eyes rapturously to the sky, as if she called the homiest sunlight to
      witness that this was the most lovable woman on the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But elderly female fascination offers its allurements in vain to the rough
      animal, man. Suspicion of Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s motives had established itself
      firmly in my mind. Why had the Popular Masseuse abandoned her brilliant
      career in London, and plunged into the obscurity of a country town? An
      opportunity of clearing up the doubt thus suggested seemed to have
      presented itself now. &ldquo;Is it indiscreet to ask,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you are here
      in your professional capacity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cunning seized its advantage and put a sly question to me. &ldquo;Do you
      wish to be one of my patients yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, unfortunately, impossible,&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;I have arranged to return
      to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at the latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Artful as she was, Mrs. Tenbruggen failed to conceal a momentary
      expression of relief which betrayed itself, partly in her manner, partly
      in her face. She had ascertained, to her own complete satisfaction, that
      my speedy departure was an event which might be relied on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not yet answered you,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I am
      eager to try my hands on you. Massage, as I practice it, would lighten
      your weight, and restore your figure; I may even say would lengthen your
      life. You will think of me, one of these days, won&rsquo;t you? In the meanwhile&mdash;yes!
      I am here in my professional capacity. Several interesting cases; and one
      very remarkable person, brought to death&rsquo;s door by the doctors; a rich man
      who is liberal in paying his fees. There is my quarrel with London and
      Londoners. Some of their papers, medical newspapers, of course, declare
      that my fees are exorbitant; and there is a tendency among the patients&mdash;I
      mean the patients who are rolling in riches&mdash;to follow the lead of
      the newspapers. I am no worm to be trodden on, in that way. The London
      people shall wait for me, until they miss me&mdash;and, when I do go back,
      they will find the fees increased. <i>My</i> fingers and thumbs, Mr.
      Governor, are not to be insulted with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall nodded her head at me. It was an eloquent nod. &ldquo;Admire my
      spirited friend,&rdquo; was the interpretation I put on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, my private sentiments suggested that Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s
      reply was too perfectly satisfactory, viewed as an explanation. My
      suspicions were by no means set at rest; and I was resolved not to let the
      subject drop yet. &ldquo;Speaking of Mr. Gracedieu, and of the chances of his
      partial recovery,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you think the Minister would benefit by
      Massage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it, if you can get rid of the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he would be an obstacle in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some medical men who are honorable exceptions to the general
      rule; and he may be one of them,&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen admitted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too
      hopeful. As a doctor, he belongs to the most tyrannical trades-union in
      existence. May I make a personal remark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find something in your manner&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t suppose that I am angry&mdash;which
      looks like distrust; I mean, distrust of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s ever ready kindness interfered in my defense: &ldquo;Oh, no,
      Elizabeth! You are not often mistaken; but indeed you are wrong now. Look
      at my distinguished friend. I remember my copy book, when I was a small
      creature learning to write, in England. There were first lines that we
      copied, in big letters, and one of them said, &lsquo;Distrust Is Mean.&rsquo; I know a
      young person, whose name begins with H, who is one mass of meanness. But&rdquo;&mdash;excellent
      Selina paused, and pointed to me with a gesture of triumph&mdash;&ldquo;no
      meanness there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen waited to hear what I had to say, scornfully insensible to
      Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s well-meant interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not altogether mistaken,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that my mind
      is in a state of distrust, but I own that you puzzle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I presume that you remember the occasion when we met at Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s house-door? You saw that I failed to recognize you, and you
      refused to give your name when the servant asked for it. A few days
      afterward, I heard you (quite accidentally) forbid Miss Jillgall to
      mention your name in my hearing. I am at a loss to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could answer me, the chaise drew up at the gate of the
      farmhouse. Mrs. Tenbruggen carefully promised to explain what had puzzled
      me, at the first opportunity. &ldquo;If it escapes my memory,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;pray
      remind me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I determined to remind her of it. Whether I could depend on her to tell me
      the truth, might be quite another thing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. THE DECISION OF EUNICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eunice ran out to meet us, and opened the gate. She was instantly folded
      in Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s arms. On her release, she came to me, eager for news of
      her father&rsquo;s health. When I had communicated all that I thought it right
      to tell her of the doctor&rsquo;s last report, she noticed Mrs. Tenbruggen. The
      appearance of a stranger seemed to embarrass her. I left Miss Jillgall to
      introduce them to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling Euneece, you remember Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s name, I am sure?
      Elizabeth, this is my sweet girl; I mentioned her in my letters to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she will be <i>my</i> sweet girl, when we know each other a little
      better. May I kiss you, dear? You have lovely eyes; but I am sorry to see
      that they don&rsquo;t look like happy eyes. You want Mamma Tenbruggen to cheer
      you. What a charming old house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arm round Eunice&rsquo;s waist and led her to the house door. Her
      enjoyment of the creepers that twined their way up the pillars of the
      porch was simply perfection as a piece of acting. When the farmer&rsquo;s wife
      presented herself, Mrs. Tenbruggen was so irresistibly amiable, and took
      such flattering notice of the children, that the harmless British matron
      actually blushed with pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, ma&rsquo;am, you must have children
      of your own,&rdquo; she said. Mrs. Tenbruggen cast her eyes on the floor, and
      sighed with pathetic resignation. A sweet little family, and all cruelly
      swept away by death. If the performance meant anything, it did most
      assuredly mean that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wonderful self-possession!&rdquo; somebody whispered in my ear. The
      children in the room were healthy, well-behaved little creatures&mdash;but
      the name of the innocent one among them was Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dinner we were shown over the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman of the house led the way, and Miss Jillgall and I
      accompanied her. The children ran on in front of us. Still keeping
      possession of Eunice, Mrs. Tenbruggen followed at some distance behind. I
      looked back, after no very long interval, and saw that a separation had
      taken place. Mrs. Tenbruggen passed me, not looking so pleasantly as
      usual, joined the children, and walked with two of them, hand in hand, a
      pattern of maternal amiability. I dropped back a little, and gave Eunice
      an opportunity of joining me; having purposely left her to form her own
      opinion, without any adverse influence exercised on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that lady a friend of yours?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;No; only an acquaintance.
      What do you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should like her at first; she was so kind, and seemed to take
      such an interest in me. But she said such strange things&mdash;asked if I
      was reckoned like my mother, and which of us was the eldest, my sister or
      myself, and whether we were my father&rsquo;s only two children, and if one of
      us was more his favorite than the other. What I could tell her, I did
      tell. But when I said I didn&rsquo;t know which of us was the oldest, she gave
      me an impudent tap on the cheek, and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you, child,&rsquo; 
      and left me. How can Selina be so fond of her? Don&rsquo;t mention it to any one
      else; I hope I shall never see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep your secret, Eunice; and you must keep mine. I entirely agree
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree with me in disliking her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We could say no more at that time. Our friends in advance were waiting for
      us. We joined them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had felt any doubt of the purpose which had really induced Mrs.
      Tenbruggen to leave London, all further uncertainty on my part was at an
      end. She had some vile interest of her own to serve by identifying Mr.
      Gracedieu&rsquo;s adopted child&mdash;but what the nature of that interest might
      be, it was impossible to guess. The future, when I thought of it now,
      filled me with dismay. A more utterly helpless position than mine it was
      not easy to conceive. To warn the Minister, in his present critical state
      of health, was simply impossible. My relations with Helena forbade me even
      to approach her. And, as for Selina, she was little less than a mere tool
      in the hands of her well-beloved friend. What, in God&rsquo;s name, was I to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner-time we found the master of the house waiting to bid us welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally speaking, he presented a remarkable contrast to the typical
      British farmer. He was neither big nor burly; he spoke English as well as
      I did; and there was nothing in his dress which would have made him a fit
      subject for a picture of rustic life. When he spoke, he was able to talk
      on subjects unconnected with agricultural pursuits; nor did I hear him
      grumble about the weather and the crops. It was pleasant to see that his
      wife was proud of him, and that he was, what all fathers ought to be, his
      children&rsquo;s best and dearest friend. Why do I dwell on these details,
      relating to a man whom I was not destined to see again? Only because I had
      reason to feel grateful to him. When my spirits were depressed by anxiety,
      he made my mind easy about Eunice, as long as she remained in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social arrangements, when our meal was over, fell of themselves into
      the right train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall went upstairs, with the mother and the children, to see the
      nursery and the bedrooms. Mrs. Tenbruggen discovered a bond of union
      between the farmer and herself; they were both skilled players at
      backgammon, and they sat down to try conclusions at their favorite game.
      Without any wearisome necessity for excuses or stratagems, Eunice took my
      arm and led me to the welcome retirement of her own sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could honestly congratulate her, when I heard that she was established
      at the farm as a member of the family. While she was governess to the
      children, she was safe from dangers that might have threatened her, if she
      had been compelled by circumstances to return to the Minister&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entry in her Journal, which she was anxious that I should read, was
      placed before me next.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed the poor child&rsquo;s account of the fearful night that she had
      passed, with an interest that held me breathless to the end. A terrible
      dream, which had impressed a sense of its reality on the sleeper by
      reaching its climax in somnambulism&mdash;this was the obvious
      explanation, no doubt; and a rational mind would not hesitate to accept
      it. But a rational mind is not a universal gift, even in a country which
      prides itself on the idol-worship of Fact. Those good friends who are
      always better acquainted with our faults, failings, and weaknesses than we
      can pretend to be ourselves, had long since discovered that my nature was
      superstitious, and my imagination likely to mislead me in the presence of
      events which encouraged it. Well! I was weak enough to recoil from the
      purely rational view of all that Eunice had suffered, and heard, and seen,
      on the fateful night recorded in her Journal. Good and Evil walk the ways
      of this unintelligible world, on the same free conditions. If we cling, as
      many of us do, to the comforting belief that departed spirits can minister
      to earthly creatures for good&mdash;can be felt moving in us, in a train
      of thought, and seen as visible manifestations, in a dream&mdash;with what
      pretense of reason can we deny that the same freedom of supernatural
      influence which is conceded to the departed spirit, working for good, is
      also permitted to the departed spirit, working for evil? If the grave
      cannot wholly part mother and child, when the mother&rsquo;s life has been good,
      does eternal annihilation separate them, when the mother&rsquo;s life has been
      wicked? No! If the departed spirit can bring with it a blessing, the
      departed spirit can bring with it a curse. I dared not confess to Eunice
      that the influence of her murderess-mother might, as I thought possible,
      have been supernaturally present when she heard temptation whispering in
      her ear; but I dared not deny it to myself. All that I could say to
      satisfy and sustain her, I did say. And when I declared&mdash;with my
      whole heart declared&mdash;that the noble passion which had elevated her
      whole being, and had triumphed over the sorest trials that desertion could
      inflict, would still triumph to the end, I saw hope, in that brave and
      true heart, showing its bright promise for the future in Eunice&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed and locked her Journal. By common consent we sought the relief
      of changing the subject. Eunice asked me if it was really necessary that I
      should return to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrank from telling her that I could be of no further use to her father,
      while he regarded me with an enmity which I had not deserved. But I saw no
      reason for concealing that it was my purpose to see Philip Dunboyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me yesterday,&rdquo; I reminded her, &ldquo;that I was to say you had
      forgiven him. Do you still wish me to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought of it seriously? Are you sure of not having been hurried
      by a generous impulse into saying more than you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking of it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;through the wakeful hours of last
      night&mdash;and many things are plain to me, which I was not sure of in
      the time when I was so happy. He has caused me the bitterest sorrow of my
      life, but he can&rsquo;t undo the good that I owe to him. He has made a better
      girl of me, in the time when his love was mine. I don&rsquo;t forget that.
      Miserably as it has ended, I don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled; the tears rose in her eyes. It was impossible for me
      to conceal the distress that I felt. The noble creature saw it. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      said faintly; &ldquo;I am not going to cry. Don&rsquo;t look so sorry for me.&rdquo; Her
      hand pressed my hand gently&mdash;<i>she</i> pitied <i>me</i>. When I saw
      how she struggled to control herself, and did control herself, I declare
      to God I could have gone down on my knees before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked to be allowed to speak of Philip again, and for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you meet with him in London, he may perhaps ask if you have seen
      Eunice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child! he is sure to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break it to him gently&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let him deceive himself. In this
      world, he must never hope to see me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried&mdash;very gently&mdash;to remonstrate. &ldquo;At your age, and at his
      age,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;surely there is hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no hope.&rdquo; She pressed her hand on her heart. &ldquo;I know it, I feel
      it, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eunice, it&rsquo;s hard for me to say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to make it easier for you. Say that I have forgiven him&mdash;and
      say no more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. THE GOVERNOR ON HIS GUARD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After leaving Eunice, my one desire was to be alone. I had much to think
      of, and I wanted an opportunity of recovering myself. On my way out of the
      house, in search of the first solitary place that I could discover, I
      passed the room in which we had dined. The door was ajar. Before I could
      get by it, Mrs. Tenbruggen stepped out and stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in here for a moment?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The farmer has been
      called away, and I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very unwillingly&mdash;but how could I have refused without giving
      offense?&mdash;I entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you noticed my keeping my name from you,&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen began,
      &ldquo;while Selina was with us, you placed me in an awkward position. Our
      little friend is an excellent creature, but her tongue runs away with her
      sometimes; I am obliged to be careful of taking her too readily into my
      confidence. For instance, I have never told her what my name was before I
      married. Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had purposely remained standing as a hint to her not to prolong the
      interview. The hint was thrown away; I took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina&rsquo;s letters had informed me,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that Mr. Gracedieu was a
      nervous invalid. When I came to England, I had hoped to try what massage
      might do to relieve him. The cure of their popular preacher might have
      advertised me through the whole of the Congregational sect. It was
      essential to my success that I should present myself as a stranger. I
      could trust time and change, and my married name (certainly not known to
      Mr. Gracedieu) to keep up my incognito. He would have refused to see me if
      he had known that I was once Miss Chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an opportunity, perhaps, of discovering what the Minister had
      failed to remember when he had been speaking of this woman, and when I had
      asked if he had ever offended her. I was especially careful in making my
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember how you spoke to Mr. Gracedieu,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you and he met,
      long ago, in my rooms. But surely you don&rsquo;t think him capable of
      vindictively remembering some thoughtless words, which escaped you sixteen
      or seventeen years since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite such a fool as that, Mr. Governor. What I was thinking of
      was an unpleasant correspondence between the Minister and myself. Before I
      was so unfortunate as to meet with Mr. Tenbruggen, I obtained a chance of
      employment in a public Institution, on condition that I included a
      clergyman among my references. Knowing nobody else whom I could apply to,
      I rashly wrote to Mr. Gracedieu, and received one of those cold and cruel
      refusals which only the strictest religious principle can produce. I was
      mortally offended at the time; and if your friend the Minister had been
      within my reach&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, and finished the sentence by a
      significant gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he is within your reach now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And out of his mind,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Besides, one&rsquo;s sense of injury doesn&rsquo;t
      last (except in novels and plays) through a series of years. I don&rsquo;t pity
      him&mdash;and if an opportunity of shaking his high position among his
      admiring congregation presented itself, I daresay I might make a
      mischievous return for his letter to me. In the meanwhile, we may drop the
      subject. I suppose you understand, now, why I concealed my name from you,
      and why I kept out of the house while you were in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain enough, of course. If I had known her again, or had heard her
      name, I might have told the Minister that Mrs. Tenbruggen and Miss Chance
      were one and the same. And if I had seen her and talked with her in the
      house, my memory might have shown itself capable of improvement. Having
      politely presented the expression of my thanks, I rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped me at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;while Selina is out of the way. I need hardly
      tell you that I have not trusted her with the Minister&rsquo;s secret. You and I
      are, as I take it, the only people now living who know the truth about
      these two girls. And we keep our advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What advantage?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I. Female folly, and a slip of the tongue; I am old and ugly,
      but I am still a woman. About Miss Eunice. Somebody has told the pretty
      little fool never to trust strangers. You would have been amused, if you
      had heard that sly young person prevaricating with me. In one respect, her
      appearance strikes me. She is not like either the wretch who was hanged,
      or the poor victim who was murdered. Can she be the adopted child? Or is
      it the other sister, whom I have not seen yet? Oh, come! come! Don&rsquo;t try
      to look as if you didn&rsquo;t know. That is really too ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alluded just now,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;to our &lsquo;advantage&rsquo; in being the only
      persons who know the truth about the two girls. Well, Mrs. Tenbruggen, I
      keep <i>my</i> advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;you leave me to make the discovery
      myself. Well, my friend, I mean to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, my hotel offered to me the refuge of which I stood in
      need. I could think, for the first time that day, without interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being resolved to see Philip, I prepared myself for the interview by
      consulting my extracts once more. The letter, in which Mrs. Tenbruggen
      figures, inspired me with the hope of protection for Mr. Gracedieu,
      attainable through no less a person than Helena herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, she would certainly share Philip&rsquo;s aversion to the
      Masseuse, and her dislike of Miss Jillgall would, just as possibly, extend
      to Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s friend. The hostile feeling thus set up might be
      trusted to keep watch on Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s proceedings, with a vigilance
      not attainable by the coarser observation of a man. In the event, of an
      improvement in the Minister&rsquo;s health, I should hear of it both from the
      doctor and from Miss Jillgall, and in that case I should instantly return
      to my unhappy friend and put him on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started for London by the early train in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My way home from the terminus took me past the hotel at which the elder
      Mr. Dunboyne was staying. I called on him. He was reported to be engaged;
      that is to say, immersed in his books. The address on one of Philip&rsquo;s
      letters had informed me that he was staying at another hotel. Pursuing my
      inquiries in this direction, I met with a severe disappointment. Mr.
      Philip Dunboyne had left the hotel that morning; for what destination
      neither the landlord nor the waiter could tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day&rsquo;s post brought with it the information which I had failed to
      obtain. Miss Jillgall wrote, informing me in her strongest language that
      Philip Dunboyne had returned to Helena. Indignant Selina added: &ldquo;Helena
      means to make him marry her; and I promise you she shall fail, if I can
      stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In taking leave of Eunice, I had given her my address; had warned her to
      be careful, if she and Mrs. Tenbruggen happened to meet again, and had
      begged her to write to me, or to come to me, if anything happened to alarm
      her in my absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two days more, I received a line from Eunice, written evidently in the
      greatest agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip has discovered me. He has been here, and has insisted on seeing
      me. I have refused. The good farmer has so kindly taken my part. I can
      write no more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. THE NEWS FROM THE FARM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I next heard from Miss Jillgall, the introductory part of her letter
      merely reminded me that Philip Dunboyne was established in the town, and
      that Helena was in daily communication with him. I shall do Selina no
      injustice if my extract begins with her second page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will sympathize, I am sure&rdquo; (she writes), &ldquo;with the indignation which
      urged me to call on Philip, and tell him the way to the farmhouse. Think
      of Helena being determined to marry him, whether he wants to or not! I am
      afraid this is bad grammar. But there are occasions when even a cultivated
      lady fails in her grammar, and almost envies the men their privilege of
      swearing when they are in a rage. My state of mind is truly indescribable.
      Grief mingles with anger, when I tell you that my sweet Euneece has
      disappointed me, for the first time since I had the happiness of knowing
      and admiring her. What can have been the motive of her refusal to receive
      her penitent lover? Is it pride? We are told that Satan fell through
      pride. Euneece satanic? Impossible! I feel inclined to go and ask her what
      has hardened her heart against a poor young man who bitterly regrets his
      own folly. Do you think it was bad advice from the farmer or his wife? In
      that case, I shall exert my influence, and take her away. You would do the
      same, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed to mention the poor dear Minister in a postscript. The truth
      is, I don&rsquo;t very well know what I am about. Mr. Gracedieu is quiet, sleeps
      better than he did, eats with a keener appetite, gives no trouble. But,
      alas, that glorious intellect is in a state of eclipse! Do not suppose,
      because I write figuratively, that I am not sorry for him. He understands
      nothing; he remembers nothing; he has my prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might come to us again, if you would only be so kind. It would make
      no difference now; the poor man is so sadly altered. I must add, most
      reluctantly, that the doctor recommends your staying at home. Between
      ourselves, he is little better than a coward. Fancy his saying; &lsquo;No; we
      must not run that risk yet.&rsquo; I am barely civil to him, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any other affair (excuse me for troubling you with a second
      postscript), my sympathy with Euneece would have penetrated her motives; I
      should have felt with her feelings. But I have never been in love; no
      gentleman gave me the opportunity when I was young. Now I am middle-aged,
      neglect has done its dreary work&mdash;my heart is an extinct crater.
      Figurative again! I had better put my pen away, and say farewell for the
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall may now give place to Eunice. The same day&rsquo;s post brought me
      both letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should be unworthy indeed of the trust which this affectionate girl has
      placed in me, if I failed to receive her explanation of her conduct toward
      Philip Dunboyne, as a sacred secret confided to my fatherly regard. In
      those later portions of her letter, which are not addressed to me
      confidentially, Eunice writes as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get news&mdash;and what heartbreaking news!&mdash;of my father, by
      sending a messenger to Selina. It is more than ever impossible that I can
      put myself in the way of seeing Helena again. She has written to me about
      Philip, in a tone so shockingly insolent and cruel, that I have destroyed
      her letter. Philip&rsquo;s visit to the farm, discovered I don&rsquo;t know how, seems
      to have infuriated her. She accuses me of doing all that she might herself
      have done in my place, and threatens me&mdash;No! I am afraid of the
      wicked whisperings of that second self of mine if I think of it. They were
      near to tempting me when I read Helena&rsquo;s letter. But I thought of what you
      said, after I had shown you my Journal; and your words took my memory back
      to the days when I was happy with Philip. The trial and the terror passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consolation has come to me from the best of good women. Mrs. Staveley
      writes as lovingly as my mother might have written, if death had spared
      her. I have replied with all the gratitude that I really feel, but without
      taking advantage of the services which she offers. Mrs. Staveley has it in
      her mind, as you had it in your mind, to bring Philip back to me. Does she
      forget, do you forget, that Helena claims him? But you both mean kindly,
      and I love you both for the interest that you feel in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The farmer&rsquo;s wife&mdash;dear good soul!&mdash;hardly understands me so
      well as her husband does. She confesses to pitying Philip. &lsquo;He is so
      wretched,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;And, dear heart, how handsome, and what nice,
      winning manners! I don&rsquo;t think I should have had your courage, in your
      place. To tell the truth, I should have jumped for joy when I saw him at
      the door; and I should have run down to let him in&mdash;and perhaps been
      sorry for it afterward. If you really wish to forget him, my dear, I will
      do all I can to help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are trifling things to mention, but I am afraid you may think I am
      unhappy&mdash;and I want to prevent that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have so much to be thankful for, and the children are so fond of me.
      Whether I teach them as well as I might have done, if I had been a more
      learned girl, may perhaps be doubtful. They do more for their governess, I
      am afraid, than their governess does for them. When they come into my room
      in the morning, and rouse me with their kisses, the hour of waking, which
      used to be so hard to endure after Philip left me, is now the happiest
      hour of my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that reassuring view of her life as a governess, the poor child&rsquo;s
      letter comes to an end.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. THE TRIUMPH OF MRS. TENBRUGGEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall appears again, after an interval, on the field of my
      extracts. My pleasant friend deserves this time a serious reception. She
      informs me that Mrs. Tenbruggen has begun the inquiries which I have the
      best reason to dread&mdash;for I alone know the end which they are
      designed to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of this news affected me in two different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was discouraging to find that circumstances had not justified my
      reliance on Helena&rsquo;s enmity as a counter-influence to Mrs. Tenbruggen. On
      the other hand, it was a relief to be assured that my return to London
      would serve, rather than compromise, the interests which it was my chief
      anxiety to defend. I had foreseen that Mrs. Tenbruggen would wait to set
      her enterprise on foot, until I was out of her way; and I had calculated
      on my absence as an event which would at least put an end to suspense by
      encouraging her to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sentences in Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s letter explain the nature of her
      interest in the proceedings of her friend, and are, on that account, worth
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are sadly changed for the worse&rdquo; (Selina writes); &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
      forget that Philip was once engaged to Euneece, and that Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s
      extraordinary conduct toward him puzzled us all. The mode of discovery
      which dear Elizabeth suggested by letter, at that time, appears to be the
      mode which she is following now. When I asked why, she said: &lsquo;Philip may
      return to Euneece; the Minister may recover&mdash;and will be all the more
      likely to do so if he tries Massage. In that case, he will probably repeat
      the conduct which surprised you; and your natural curiosity will ask me
      again to find out what it means. Am I your friend, Selina, or am I not?&rsquo; 
      This was so delightfully kind, and so irresistibly conclusive, that I
      kissed her in a transport of gratitude. With what breathless interest I
      have watched her progress toward penetrating the mystery of the girls&rsquo; 
      ages, it is quite needless to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s method of keeping Miss Jillgall in ignorance of what she
      was really about, and Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s admirable confidence in the
      integrity of Mrs. Tenbruggen, being now set forth on the best authority,
      an exact presentation of the state of affairs will be completed if I add a
      word more, relating to the positions actually occupied toward Mrs.
      Tenbruggen&rsquo;s enterprise, by my correspondent and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her side, Miss Jillgall was entirely ignorant that one of the two girls
      was not Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughter, but his adopted child. On my side, I was
      entirely ignorant of Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s purpose in endeavoring to identify
      the daughter of the murderess. Speaking of myself, individually, let me
      add that I only waited the event to protect the helpless ones&mdash;my
      poor demented friend, and the orphan whom his mercy received into his
      heart and his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall goes on with her curious story, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      .......
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always desirous of making myself useful, I thought I would give my dear
      Elizabeth a hint which might save time and trouble. &lsquo;Why not begin,&rsquo; I
      suggested, &lsquo;by asking the Governor to help you?&rsquo; That wonderful woman
      never forgets anything. She had already applied to you, without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my next attempt to be useful, I did violence to my most cherished
      convictions, by presenting the wretch Helena to the admirable Elizabeth.
      That the former would be cold as ice, in her reception of any friend of
      mine, was nothing wonderful. Mrs. Tenbruggen passed it over with the
      graceful composure of a woman of the world. In the course of conversation
      with Helena, she slipped in a question: &lsquo;Might I ask if you are older than
      your sister?&rsquo; The answer was, of course: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; And here, for
      once, the most deceitful girl in existence spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were alone again, Elizabeth made a remark: &lsquo;If personal
      appearance could decide the question,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the disagreeable young
      woman is the oldest of the two. The next thing to be done is to discover
      if looks are to be trusted in this case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s lawyer received confidential instructions (not shown to me,
      which seems rather hard) to trace the two Miss Gracedieus&rsquo; registers of
      birth. Elizabeth described this proceeding (not very intelligibly to my
      mind) as a means of finding out which of the girls could be identified by
      name as the elder of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The report arrived this morning. I was only informed that the result, in
      one case, had entirely defeated the inquiries. In the other case,
      Elizabeth had helped her agent by referring him to a Birth, advertised in
      the customary columns of the <i>Times</i> newspaper. Even here, there was
      a fatal obstacle. The name of the place in which Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughter
      had been born was not added, as usual. I still tried to be useful. Had my
      friend known the Minister&rsquo;s wife? My friend had never even seen the
      Minister&rsquo;s wife. And, as if by a fatality, her portrait was no longer in
      existence. I could only mention that Helena was like her mother. But
      Elizabeth seemed to attach very little importance to my evidence, if I may
      call it by so grand a name. &lsquo;People have such strange ideas about
      likenesses,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and arrive at such contradictory conclusions. One
      can only trust one&rsquo;s own eyes in a matter of that kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend next asked me about our domestic establishment. We had only a
      cook and a housemaid. If they were old servants who had known the girls as
      children, they might be made of some use. Our luck was as steadily against
      us as ever. They had both been engaged when Mr. Gracedieu assumed his new
      pastoral duties, after having resided with his wife at her native place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked Elizabeth what she proposed to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She deferred her answer, until I had first told her whether the visit of
      the doctor might be expected on that day. I could reply to this in the
      negative. Elizabeth, thereupon, made a startling request; she begged me to
      introduce her to Mr. Gracedieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Surely, you have forgotten the sad state of his mind?&rsquo; No; she
      knew perfectly well that he was imbecile. &lsquo;I want to try,&rsquo; she explained,
      &lsquo;if I can rouse him for a few minutes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By Massage?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She burst out laughing. &lsquo;Massage, my dear, doesn&rsquo;t act in that way. It is
      an elaborate process, pursued patiently for weeks together. But my hands
      have more than one accomplishment at their finger-ends. Oh, make your mind
      easy! I shall do no harm, if I do no good. Take me, Selina, to the
      Minister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went to his room. Don&rsquo;t blame me for giving way; I am too fond of
      Elizabeth to be able to disappoint her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sad sight when we went in. He was quite happy, playing like a
      child, at cup-and-ball. The attendant retired at my request. I introduced
      Mrs. Tenbruggen. He smiled and shook hands with her. He said: &lsquo;Are you a
      Christian or a Pagan? You are very pretty. How many times can you catch
      the ball in the cup?&rsquo; The effort to talk to her ended there. He went on
      with his game, and seemed to forget that there was anybody in the room. It
      made my heart ache to remember what he was&mdash;and to see him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth whispered: &lsquo;Leave me alone with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I did such a rude thing&mdash;I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth asked me if I had no confidence in her. I was ashamed of
      myself; I left them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long half-hour passed. Feeling a little uneasy, I went upstairs again
      and looked into the room. He was leaning back in his chair; his plaything
      was on the floor, and he was looking vacantly at the light that came in
      through the window. I found Mrs. Tenbruggen at the other end of the room,
      in the act of ringing the bell. Nothing in the least out of the ordinary
      way seemed to have happened. When the attendant had answered the bell, we
      left the room together. Mr. Gracedieu took no notice of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;how has it ended?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite calmly my noble Elizabeth answered: &lsquo;In total failure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What did you say to him after you sent me away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I tried, in every possible way, to get him to tell me which of his two
      daughters was the oldest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did he refuse to answer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He was only too ready to answer. First, he said Helena was the oldest&mdash;then
      he corrected himself, and declared that Eunice was the oldest&mdash;then
      he said they were twins&mdash;then he went back to Helena and Eunice. Now
      one was the oldest, and now the other. He rang the changes on those two
      names, I can&rsquo;t tell you how often, and seemed to think it a better game
      than cup-and-ball.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing is to be done, Selina.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;you give it up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heroic friend answered: &lsquo;I know when I am beaten, my dear&mdash;I give
      it up.&rsquo; She looked at her watch; it was time to operate on the muscles of
      one of her patients. Away she went, on her glorious mission of Massage,
      without a murmur of regret. What strength of mind! But, oh, dear, what a
      disappointment for poor little me! On one thing I am determined. If I find
      myself getting puzzled or frightened, I shall instantly write to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that expression of confidence in me, Selina&rsquo;s narrative came to an
      end. I wish I could have believed, as she did, that the object of her
      admiration had been telling her the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, Mrs. Tenbruggen honored me with a visit at my house in
      the neighborhood of London. Thanks to this circumstance, I am able to add
      a postscript which will complete the revelations in Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrious Masseuse, having much to conceal from her faithful Selina,
      was well aware that she had only one thing to keep hidden from me; namely,
      the advantage which she would have gained if her inquiries had met with
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might have got at what I wanted,&rdquo; she told me, &ldquo;by
      mesmerizing our reverend friend. He is as weak as a woman; I threw him
      into hysterics, and had to give it up, and quiet him, or he would have
      alarmed the house. You look as if you don&rsquo;t believe in mesmerism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My looks, Mrs. Tenbruggen, exactly express my opinion. Mesmerism is a
      humbug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amusing old Tory! Shall I throw you into a state of trance? No! I&rsquo;ll
      give you a shock of another kind&mdash;a shock of surprise. I know as much
      as you do about Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughters. What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like to hear you tell me, which is the adopted child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helena, to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her manner was defiant, her tone was positive; I doubted both. Under the
      surface of her assumed confidence, I saw something which told me that she
      was trying to read my thoughts in my face. Many other women had tried to
      do that. They succeeded when I was young. When I had reached the wrong
      side of fifty, my face had learned discretion, and they failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you arrive at your discovery?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I know of nobody who
      could have helped you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I helped myself, sir! I reasoned it out. A wonderful thing for a woman to
      do, isn&rsquo;t it? I wonder whether you could follow the process?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My reply to this was made by a bow. I was sure of my command over my face;
      but perfect control of the voice is a rare power. Here and there, a great
      actor or a great criminal possesses it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s vanity took me into her confidence. &ldquo;In the first
      place,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Helena is plainly the wicked one of the two. I was not
      prejudiced by what Selina had told me of her: I saw it, and felt it,
      before I had been five minutes in her company. If lying tongues ever
      provoke her as lying tongues provoked her mother, she will follow her
      mother&rsquo;s example. Very well. Now&mdash;in the second place&mdash;though it
      is very slight, there is a certain something in her hair and her
      complexion which reminds me of the murderess: there is no other
      resemblance, I admit. In the third place, the girls&rsquo; names point to the
      same conclusion. Mr. Gracedieu is a Protestant and a Dissenter. Would he
      call a child of his own by the name of a Roman Catholic saint? No! he
      would prefer a name in the Bible; Eunice is <i>his</i> child. And Helena
      was once the baby whom I carried into the prison. Do you deny that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only four words! But they were deceitfully spoken, and the deceit&mdash;practiced
      in Eunice&rsquo;s interest, it is needless to say&mdash;succeeded. Mrs.
      Tenbruggen&rsquo;s object in visiting me was attained; I had confirmed her
      belief in the delusion that Helena was the adopted child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up to take her leave. I asked if she proposed remaining in London.
      No; she was returning to her country patients that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I attended her to the house-door, she turned to me with her mischievous
      smile. &ldquo;I have taken some trouble in finding the clew to the Minister&rsquo;s
      mystery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wonder why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did wonder,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;would you tell me why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at the bare idea of it. &ldquo;Another lesson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to assist
      a helpless man in studying the weaker sex. I have already shown you that a
      woman can reason. Learn next that a woman can keep a secret. Good-by. God
      bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the events which followed Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s visit it is not possible
      for me, I am thankful to say, to speak from personal experience. Ought I
      to conclude with an expression of repentance for the act of deception to
      which I have already pleaded guilty? I don&rsquo;t know. Yes! the force of
      circumstances does really compel me to say it, and say it seriously&mdash;I
      declare, on my word of honor, I don&rsquo;t know.

      CHAPTER LII. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While my father remains in his present helpless condition, somebody must
      assume a position of command in this house. There cannot be a moment&rsquo;s
      doubt that I am the person to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my agitated state of mind, sometimes doubtful of Philip, sometimes
      hopeful of him, I find Mrs. Tenbruggen simply unendurable. A female doctor
      is, under any circumstances, a creature whom I detest. She is, at her very
      best, a bad imitation of a man. The Medical Rubber is worse than this; she
      is a bad imitation of a mountebank. Her grinning good-humor, adopted no
      doubt to please the fools who are her patients, and her impudent enjoyment
      of hearing herself talk, make me regret for the first time in my life that
      I am a young lady. If I belonged to the lowest order of the population, I
      might take the first stick I could find, and enjoy the luxury of giving
      Mrs. Tenbruggen a good beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      She literally haunts the house, encouraged, of course, by her wretched
      little dupe, Miss Jillgall. Only this morning, I tried what a broad hint
      would do toward suggesting that her visits had better come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Tenbruggen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I must request Miss Jillgall to
      moderate her selfish enjoyment of your company, for your own sake. Your
      time is too valuable, in a professional sense, to be wasted on an idle
      woman who has no sympathy with your patients, waiting for relief perhaps,
      and waiting in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened to this, all smiles and good-humor: &ldquo;My dear, do you know how
      I might answer you, if I was an ill-natured woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no curiosity to hear it, Mrs. Tenbruggen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might ask you,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;to allow me to mind my own business.
      But I am incapable of making an ungrateful return for the interest which
      you take in my medical welfare. Let me venture to ask if you understand
      the value of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to say much more, Mrs. Tenbruggen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to make a sensible remark, my child. If you feel tired, permit
      me&mdash;here is a chair. Father Time, dear Miss Gracedieu, has always
      been a good friend of mine, because I know how to make the best use of
      him. The author of the famous saying <i>Tempus fugit</i> (you understand
      Latin, of course) was, I take leave to think, an idle man. The more I have
      to do, the readier Time is to wait for me. Let me impress this on your
      mind by some interesting examples. The greatest conqueror of the century&mdash;Napoleon&mdash;had
      time enough for everything. The greatest novelist of the century&mdash;Sir
      Walter Scott&mdash;had time enough for everything. At my humble distance,
      I imitate those illustrious men, and my patients never complain of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear&mdash;for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a clever woman, Mrs. Tenbruggen and you know it. You have an
      eloquent tongue, and you know it. But you are something else, which you
      don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of. You are a Bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst out laughing, with the air of a woman who thoroughly enjoyed a
      good joke. I looked back when I left the room, and saw the friend of
      Father Time in the easy chair opening our newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a specimen of the customary encounter of our wits. I place it on
      record in my Journal, to excuse myself <i>to</i> myself. When she left us
      at last, later in the day, I sent a letter after her to the hotel. Not
      having kept a copy of it, let me present the substance, like a sermon,
      under three heads: I begged to be excused for speaking plainly; I declared
      that there was a total want of sympathy between us, on my side; and I
      proposed that she should deprive me of future opportunities of receiving
      her in this house. The reply arrived immediately in these terms: &ldquo;Your
      letter received, dear girl. I am not in the least angry; partly because I
      am very fond of you, partly because I know that you will ask me to come
      back again. P. S.: Philip sends his love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last piece of insolence was unquestionably a lie. Philip detests her.
      They are both staying at the same hotel. But I happen to know that he
      won&rsquo;t even look at her, if they meet by accident on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who can enjoy the melancholy spectacle of human nature in a state
      of degradation would be at a loss which exhibition to prefer&mdash;an ugly
      old maid in a rage, or an ugly old maid in tears. Miss Jillgall presented
      herself in both characters when she heard what had happened. To my mind,
      Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s bosom-friend is a creature not fit to be seen or heard
      when she loses her temper. I only told her to leave the room. To my great
      amusement, she shook her bony fist at me, and expressed a frantic wish:
      &ldquo;Oh, if I was rich enough to leave this wicked house!&rdquo; I wonder whether
      there is insanity (as well as poverty) in Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s family?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night my mind was in a harassed state. Philip was, as usual, the
      cause of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I acted indiscreetly when I insisted on his leaving London, and
      returning to this place. But what else could I have done? It was not
      merely my interest, it was an act of downright necessity, to withdraw him
      from the influence of his hateful father&mdash;whom I now regard as the
      one serious obstacle to my marriage. There is no prospect of being rid of
      Mr. Dunboyne the elder by his returning to Ireland. He is trying a new
      remedy for his crippled hand&mdash;electricity. I wish it was lightning,
      to kill him! If I had given that wicked old man the chance, I am firmly
      convinced he would not have let a day pass without doing his best to
      depreciate me in his son&rsquo;s estimation. Besides, there was the risk, if I
      had allowed Philip to remain long away from me, of losing&mdash;no, while
      I keep my beauty I cannot be in such danger as that&mdash;let me say, of
      permitting time and absence to weaken my hold on him. However sullen and
      silent he may be, when we meet&mdash;and I find him in that condition far
      too often&mdash;I can, sooner or later, recall him to his brighter self.
      My eyes preserve their charm, my talk can still amuse him, and, better
      even than that, I feel the answering thrill in him, which tells me how
      precious my kisses are&mdash;not too lavishly bestowed! But the time when
      I am obliged to leave him to himself is the time that I dread. How do I
      know that his thoughts are not wandering away to Eunice? He denies it; he
      declares that he only went to the farmhouse to express his regret for his
      own thoughtless conduct, and to offer her the brotherly regard due to the
      sister of his promised wife. Can I believe it? Oh, what would I not give
      to be able to believe it! How can I feel sure that her refusal to see him
      was not a cunning device to make him long for another interview, and plan
      perhaps in private to go back and try again. Marriage! Nothing will quiet
      these frightful doubts of mine, nothing will reward me for all that I have
      suffered, nothing will warm my heart with the delightful sense of triumph
      over Eunice, but my marriage to Philip. And what does he say, when I urge
      it on him?&mdash;yes, I have fallen as low as that, in the despair which
      sometimes possesses me. He has his answer, always the same, and always
      ready: &ldquo;How are we to live? where is the money?&rdquo; The maddening part of it
      is that I cannot accuse him of raising objections that don&rsquo;t exist. We are
      poorer than ever here, since my father&rsquo;s illness&mdash;and Philip&rsquo;s
      allowance is barely enough to suffice him as a single man. Oh, how I hate
      the rich!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to think of going to bed. How could I hope to sleep, with
      my head throbbing, and my thoughts in this disturbed state? I put on my
      comfortable dressing-gown, and sat down to try what reading would do to
      quiet my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had borrowed the book from the Library, to which I have been a
      subscriber in secret for some time past. It was an old volume, full of
      what we should now call Gossip; relating strange adventures, and
      scandalous incidents in family history which had been concealed from
      public notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these last romances in real life caught a strong hold on my
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange case of intended poisoning, which had never been carried
      out. A young married lady of rank, whose name was concealed under an
      initial letter, had suffered some unendurable wrong (which was not
      mentioned) at the hands of her husband&rsquo;s mother. The wife was described as
      a woman of strong passions, who had determined on a terrible revenge by
      taking the life of her mother-in-law. There were difficulties in the way
      of her committing the crime without an accomplice to help her; and she
      decided on taking her maid, an elderly woman, into her confidence. The
      poison was secretly obtained by this person; and the safest manner of
      administering it was under discussion between the mistress and the maid,
      when the door of the room was suddenly opened. The husband, accompanied by
      his brother, rushed in, and charged his wife with plotting the murder of
      his mother. The young lady (she was only twenty-three) must have been a
      person of extraordinary courage and resolution. She saw at once that her
      maid had betrayed her, and, with astonishing presence of mind, she turned
      on the traitress, and said to her husband: &ldquo;There is the wretch who has
      been trying to persuade me to poison your mother!&rdquo; As it happened, the old
      lady&rsquo;s temper was violent and overbearing; and the maid had complained of
      being ill-treated by her, in the hearing of the other servants. The
      circumstances made it impossible to decide which of the two was really the
      guilty woman. The servant was sent away, and the husband and wife
      separated soon afterward, under the excuse of incompatibility of temper.
      Years passed; and the truth was only discovered by the death-bed
      confession of the wife. A remarkable story, which has made such an
      impression on me that I have written it in my Journal. I am not rich
      enough to buy the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last two days, I have been confined to my room with a bad feverish
      cold&mdash;caught, as I suppose, by sitting at an open window reading my
      book till nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. I sent a note to Philip,
      telling him of my illness. On the first day, he called to inquire after
      me. On the second day, no visit, and no letter. Here is the third day&mdash;and
      no news of him as yet. I am better, but not fit to go out. Let me wait
      another hour, and, if that exertion of patience meets with no reward, I
      shall send a note to the hotel. No news of Philip. I have sent to the
      hotel. The servant has just returned, bringing me back my note. The waiter
      informed her that Mr. Dunboyne had gone away to London by the morning
      train. No apology or explanation left for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Can</i> he have deserted me? I am in such a frenzy of doubt and rage
      that I can hardly write that horrible question. Is it possible&mdash;oh, I
      feel it <i>is</i> possible that he has gone away with Eunice. Do I know
      where to find them? if I did know, what could I do? I feel as if I could
      kill them both!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the heat of my anger had cooled, I made two discoveries. One cost me
      a fee to a messenger, and the other exposed me to the insolence of a
      servant. I pay willingly in my purse and my pride, when the gain is peace
      of mind. Through my messenger I ascertained that Eunice had never left the
      farm. Through my own inquiries, answered by the waiter with an impudent
      grin, I heard that Philip had left orders to have his room kept for him.
      What misery our stupid housemaid might have spared me, if she had thought
      of putting that question when I sent her to the hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day passed in vain speculations on Philip&rsquo;s motive for
      this sudden departure. What poor weak creatures we are! I persuaded myself
      to hope that anxiety for our marriage had urged him to make an effort to
      touch the heart of his mean father. Shall I see him to-morrow? And shall I
      have reason to be fonder of him than ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      We met again to-day as usual. He has behaved infamously.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I asked what had been his object in going to London, I was told that
      it was &ldquo;a matter of business.&rdquo; He made that idiotic excuse as coolly as if
      he really thought I should believe it. I submitted in silence, rather than
      mar his return to me by the disaster of a quarrel. But this was an unlucky
      day. A harder trial of my self-control was still to come. Without the
      slightest appearance of shame, Philip informed me that he was charged with
      a message from Mrs. Tenbruggen! She wanted some Irish lace, and would I be
      so good as to tell her which was the best shop at which she could buy it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he really in earnest? &ldquo;You,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;who distrusted and detested her&mdash;you
      are on friendly terms with that woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remonstrated with me. &ldquo;My dear Helena, don&rsquo;t speak in that way of Mrs.
      Tenbruggen. We have both been mistaken about her. That good creature has
      forgiven the brutal manner in which I spoke to her, when she was in
      attendance on my father. She was the first to propose that we should shake
      hands and forget it. My darling, don&rsquo;t let all the good feeling be on one
      side. You have no idea how kindly she speaks of you, and how anxious she
      is to help us to be married. Come! come! meet her half-way. Write down the
      name of the shop on my card, and I will take it back to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheer amazement kept me silent: I let him go on. He was a mere child in
      the hands of Mrs. Tenbruggen: she had only to determine to make a fool of
      him, and she could do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why did she do it? What advantage had she to gain by insinuating
      herself in this way into his good opinion, evidently with the intention of
      urging him to reconcile us to each other? How could we two poor young
      people be of the smallest use to the fashionable Masseuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      My silence began to irritate Philip. &ldquo;I never knew before how obstinate
      you could be,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you seem to be doing your best&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      imagine why&mdash;to lower yourself in my estimation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I held my tongue; I assumed my smile. It is all very well for men to talk
      about the deceitfulness of women. What chance (I should like to ask
      somebody who knows about it) do the men give us of making our lives with
      them endurable, except by deceit! I gave way, of course, and wrote down
      the address of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so pleased that he kissed me. Yes! the most fondly affectionate
      kiss that he had given me, for weeks past, was my reward for submitting to
      Mrs. Tenbruggen. She is old enough to be his mother, and almost as ugly as
      Miss Jillgall&mdash;and she has made her interests his interests already!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, I fully expected to receive a visit from Mrs. Tenbruggen.
      She knew better than that. I only got a polite little note, thanking me
      for the address, and adding an artless concession: &ldquo;I earn more money than
      I know what to do with; and I adore Irish lace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day came, and still she was careful not to show herself too eager
      for a personal reconciliation. A splendid nosegay was sent to me, with
      another little note: &ldquo;A tribute, dear Helena, offered by one of my
      grateful patients. Too beautiful a present for an old woman like me. I
      agree with the poet: &lsquo;Sweets to the sweet.&rsquo; A charming thought of
      Shakespeare&rsquo;s, is it not? I should like to verify the quotation. Would you
      mind leaving the volume for me in the hall, if I call to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well done, Mrs. Tenbruggen! She doesn&rsquo;t venture to intrude on Miss
      Gracedieu in the drawing-room; she only wants to verify a quotation in the
      hall. Oh, goddess of Humility (if there is such a person), how becomingly
      you are dressed when your milliner is an artful old woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      While this reflection was passing through my mind, Miss Jillgall came in&mdash;saw
      the nosegay on the table&mdash;and instantly pounced on it. &ldquo;Oh, for me!
      for me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I noticed it this morning on Elizabeth&rsquo;s table. How
      very kind of her!&rdquo; She plunged her inquisitive nose into the poor flowers,
      and looked up sentimentally at the ceiling. &ldquo;The perfume of goodness,&rdquo; she
      remarked, &ldquo;mingled with the perfume of flowers!&rdquo; &ldquo;When you have quite done
      with it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;perhaps you will be so good as to return my nosegay?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Your</i>
      nosegay!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There is Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; I replied,
      &ldquo;if you would like to look at it.&rdquo; She did look at it. All the bile in her
      body flew up into her eyes, and turned them green; she looked as if she
      longed to scratch my face. I gave the flowers afterward to Maria; Miss
      Jillgall&rsquo;s nose had completely spoiled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been too ridiculous to have allowed Mrs. Tenbruggen to
      consult Shakespeare in the hall. I had the honor of receiving her in my
      own room. We accomplished a touching reconciliation, and we quite forgot
      Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She troubles me; she does indeed trouble me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set herself entirely right with Philip, she is determined on
      performing the same miracle with me. Her reform of herself is already
      complete. Her vulgar humor was kept under strict restraint; she was quiet
      and well-bred, and readier to listen than to talk. This change was not
      presented abruptly. She contrived to express her friendly interests in
      Philip and in me by hints dropped here and there, assisted in their effort
      by answers on my part, into which I was tempted so skillfully that I only
      discovered the snare set for me, on reflection. What is it, I ask again,
      that she has in view in taking all this trouble? Where is her motive for
      encouraging a love-affair, which Miss Jillgall must have denounced to her
      as an abominable wrong inflicted on Eunice? Money (even if there was a
      prospect of such a thing, in our case) cannot be her object; it is quite
      true that her success sets her above pecuniary anxiety. Spiteful feeling
      against Eunice is out of the question. They have only met once; and her
      opinion was expressed to me with evident sincerity: &ldquo;Your sister is a nice
      girl, but she is like other nice girls&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;
       There is Eunice&rsquo;s character, drawn from the life in few words. In what an
      irritating position do I find myself placed! Never before have I felt so
      interested in trying to look into a person&rsquo;s secret mind; and never before
      have I been so completely baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had written as far as this, and was on the point of closing my Journal,
      when a third note arrived from Mrs. Tenbruggen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been thinking about me at intervals (she wrote) all through the
      rest of the day; and, kindly as I had received her, she was conscious of
      being the object of doubts on my part which her visit had failed to
      remove. Might she ask leave to call on me, in the hope of improving her
      position in my estimation? An appointment followed for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can she have to say to me which she has not already said? Is it
      anything about Philip, I wonder?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At our interview of the next day, Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s capacity for
      self-reform appeared under a new aspect. She dropped all familiarity with
      me, and she stated the object of her visit without a superfluous word of
      explanation or apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought this a remarkable effort for a woman; and I recognized the merit
      of it by leaving the lion&rsquo;s share of the talk to my visitor. In these
      terms she opened her business with me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Philip Dunboyne told you why he went to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made a commonplace excuse,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Business, he said, took him
      to London. I know no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a fair prospect of happiness, Miss Helena, when you are married&mdash;your
      future husband is evidently afraid of you. I am not afraid of you; and I
      shall confide to your private ear something which you have an interest in
      knowing. The business which took young Mr. Dunboyne to London was to
      consult a competent person, on a matter concerning himself. The competent
      person is the sagacious (not to say sly) old gentleman&mdash;whom we used
      to call the Governor. You know him, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I am at a loss to imagine why Philip should have consulted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard or read, Miss Helena, of such a thing as &lsquo;an old
      man&rsquo;s fancy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the Governor has taken an old man&rsquo;s fancy to your sister. They
      appeared to understand each other perfectly when I was at the farmhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Tenbruggen, that is what I know already. Why did Philip
      go to the Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;If anybody is acquainted with the true state of your sister&rsquo;s
      feelings, the Governor is the man. I sent Mr. Dunboyne to consult him&mdash;and
      there is the reason for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This open avowal of her motives perplexed and offended me. After declaring
      herself to be interested in my marriage-engagement had she changed her
      mind, and resolved on favoring Philip&rsquo;s return to Eunice? What right had
      he to consult anybody about the state of that girl&rsquo;s feelings? <i>My</i>
      feelings form the only subject of inquiry that was properly open to him. I
      should have said something which I might have afterward regretted, if Mrs.
      Tenbruggen had allowed me the opportunity. Fortunately for both of us, she
      went on with her narrative of her own proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Dunboyne is an excellent fellow,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;I really like
      him&mdash;but he has his faults. He sadly wants strength of purpose; and,
      like weak men in general, he only knows his own mind when a resolute
      friend takes him in hand and guides him. I am his resolute friend. I saw
      him veering about between you and Eunice; and I decided for his sake&mdash;may
      I say for your sake also?&mdash;on putting an end to that mischievous
      state of indecision. You have the claim on him; you are the right wife for
      him, and the Governor was (as I thought likely from what I had myself
      observed) the man to make him see it. I am not in anybody&rsquo;s secrets; it
      was pure guesswork on my part, and it has succeeded. There is no more
      doubt now about Miss Eunice&rsquo;s sentiments. The question is settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly in your favor&mdash;or I should not have said a word about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Philip&rsquo;s visit kindly received? Or did the old wretch laugh at him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Gracedieu, the old wretch is a man of the world, and never
      makes mistakes of that sort. Before he could open his lips, he had to
      satisfy himself that your lover deserved to be taken into his confidence,
      on the delicate subject of Eunice&rsquo;s sentiments. He arrived at a favorable
      conclusion. I can repeat Philip&rsquo;s questions and the Governor&rsquo;s answers
      after putting the young man through a stiff examination just as they
      passed: &lsquo;May I inquire, sir, if she has spoken to you about me?&rsquo; &lsquo;She has
      often spoken about you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Did she seem to be angry with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;She is too
      good and too sweet to be angry with you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you think she will forgive
      me?&rsquo; &lsquo;She has forgiven you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Did she say so herself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, of her own
      free will.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why did she refuse to see me when I called at the farm?&rsquo; &lsquo;She
      had her own reasons&mdash;good reasons.&rsquo; &lsquo;Has she regretted it since?&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it likely that she would consent, if I proposed a
      reconciliation?&rsquo; &lsquo;I put that question to her myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;How did she take
      it, sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;She declined to take it.&rsquo; &lsquo;You mean that she declined a
      reconciliation?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you sure she was in earnest?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am
      positively sure.&rsquo; That last answer seems, by young Dunboyne&rsquo;s own
      confession, to have been enough, and more than enough for him. He got up
      to go&mdash;and then an odd thing happened. After giving him the most
      unfavorable answers, the Governor patted him paternally on the shoulder,
      and encouraged him to hope. &lsquo;Before we say good-by, Mr. Philip, one word
      more. If I was as young as you are, I should not despair.&rsquo; There is a
      sudden change of front! Who can explain it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor&rsquo;s mischievous resolution to reconcile Philip and Eunice
      explained it, of course. With the best intentions (perhaps) Mrs.
      Tenbruggen had helped that design by bringing the two men together. &ldquo;Go
      on,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I am prepared to hear next that Philip has paid another
      visit to my sister, and has been received this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must say this for Mrs. Tenbruggen: she kept her temper perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been to the farm,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but he has done something nearly
      as foolish. He has written to your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has received a favorable reply, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand into the pocket of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your sister&rsquo;s reply,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any persons who have had a crushing burden lifted, unexpectedly and
      instantly, from off their minds, will know what I felt when I read the
      reply. In the most positive language, Eunice refused to correspond with
      Philip, or to speak with him. The concluding words proved that she was in
      earnest. &ldquo;You are engaged to Helena. Consider me as a stranger until you
      are married. After that time you will be my brother-in-law, and then I may
      pardon you for writing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody who knows Eunice would have supposed that she possessed those two
      valuable qualities&mdash;common-sense and proper pride. It is pleasant to
      feel that I can now send cards to my sister, when I am Mrs. Philip
      Dunboyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned the letter to Mrs. Tenbruggen, with the sincerest expressions
      of regret for having doubted her. &ldquo;I have been unworthy of your generous
      interest in me,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I am almost ashamed to offer you my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand, and gave it a good, heady shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we friends?&rdquo; she asked, in the simplest and prettiest manner. &ldquo;Then
      let us be easy and pleasant again,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Will you call me
      Elizabeth; and shall I call you Helena? Very well. Now I have got
      something else to say; another secret which must be kept from Philip (I
      call <i>him</i> by his name now, you see) for a few days more. Your
      happiness, my dear, must not depend on his miserly old father. He must
      have a little income of his own to marry on. Among the hundreds of
      unfortunate wretches whom I have relieved from torture of mind and body,
      there is a grateful minority. Small! small! but there they are. I have
      influence among powerful people; and I am trying to make Philip private
      secretary to a member of Parliament. When I have succeeded, you shall tell
      him the good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a vile humor I must have been in, at the time, not to have
      appreciated the delightful gayety of this good creature; I went to the
      other extreme now, and behaved like a gushing young miss fresh from
      school. I kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst out laughing. &ldquo;What a sacrifice!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;A kiss for me,
      which ought to have been kept for Philip! By-the-by, do you know what I
      should do, Helena, in your place? I should take our handsome young man
      away from that hotel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do anything that you advise,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will do well, my child. In the first place, the hotel is too
      expensive for Philip&rsquo;s small means. In the second place, two of the
      chambermaids have audaciously presumed to be charming girls; and the men,
      my dear&mdash;well! well! I will leave you to find that out for yourself.
      In the third place, you want to have Philip under your own wing; domestic
      familiarity will make him fonder of you than ever. Keep him out of the
      sort of company that he meets with in the billiard-room and the
      smoking-room. You have got a spare bed here, I know, and your poor father
      is in no condition to use his authority. Make Philip one of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last piece of advice staggered me. I mentioned the Proprieties. Mrs.
      Tenbruggen laughed at the Proprieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make Selina of some use,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;While you have got <i>her</i>
      in the house, Propriety is rampant. Why condemn poor helpless Philip to
      cheap lodgings? Time enough to cast him out to the feather-bed and the
      fleas on the night before your marriage. Besides, I shall be in and out
      constantly&mdash;for I mean to cure your father. The tongue of scandal is
      silent in my awful presence; an atmosphere of virtue surrounds Mamma
      Tenbruggen. Think of it.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LV. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I did think of it. Philip came to us, and lived in our house.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let me hasten to add that the protest of Propriety was duly entered, on
      the day before my promised husband arrived. Standing in the doorway&mdash;nothing
      would induce her to take a chair, or even to enter the room&mdash;Miss
      Jillgall delivered her opinion on Philip&rsquo;s approaching visit. Mrs.
      Tenbruggen reported it in her pocket-book, as if she was representing a
      newspaper at a public meeting. Here it is, copied from her notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Helena Gracedieu, my first impulse under the present disgusting
      circumstances was to leave the house, and earn a bare crust in the
      cheapest garret I could find in the town. But my grateful heart remembers
      Mr. Gracedieu. My poor afflicted cousin was good to me when I was
      helpless. I cannot forsake him when <i>he</i> is helpless. At whatever
      sacrifice of my own self-respect, I remain under this roof, so dear to me
      for the Minister&rsquo;s sake. I notice, miss, that you smile. I see my once
      dear Elizabeth, the friend who has so bitterly disappointed me&mdash;&rdquo; she
      stopped, and put her handkerchief to her eyes, and went on again&mdash;&ldquo;the
      friend who has so bitterly disappointed me, taking satirical notes of what
      I say. I am not ashamed of what I say. The virtue which will not stretch a
      little, where the motive is good, is feeble virtue indeed. I shall stay in
      the house, and witness horrors, and rise superior to them. Good-morning,
      Miss Gracedieu. Good-morning, Elizabeth.&rdquo; She performed a magnificent
      curtsey, and (as Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s experience of the stage informed me)
      made a very creditable exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week has passed, and I have not opened my Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      My days have glided away in one delicious flow of happiness. Philip has
      been delightfully devoted to me. His fervent courtship, far exceeding any
      similar attentions which he may once have paid to Eunice, has shown such
      variety and such steadfastness of worship, that I despair of describing
      it. My enjoyment of my new life is to be felt&mdash;not to be coldly
      considered, and reduced to an imperfect statement in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time I feel capable, if the circumstances encouraged me, of
      acts of exalted virtue. For instance, I could save my country if my
      country was worth it. I could die a martyr to religion if I had a
      religion. In one word, I am exceedingly well satisfied with myself. The
      little disappointments of life pass over me harmless. I do not even regret
      the failure of good Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s efforts to find an employment for
      Philip, worthy of his abilities and accomplishments. The member of
      Parliament to whom she had applied has chosen a secretary possessed of
      political influence. That is the excuse put forward in his letter to Mrs.
      Tenbruggen. Wretched corrupt creature! If he was worth a thought I should
      pity him. He has lost Philip&rsquo;s services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days more have slipped by. The aspect of my heaven on earth is
      beginning to alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the author of that wonderful French novel, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Ame Damne&rsquo;e,&rdquo; is
      right when he tells us that human happiness is misery in masquerade. It
      would be wrong to say that I am miserable. But I may be on the way to it;
      I am anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, when he did not know that I was observing him, I discovered a
      preoccupied look in Philip&rsquo;s eyes. He laughed when I asked if anything had
      happened to vex him. Was it a natural laugh? He put his arm round me and
      kissed me. Was it done mechanically? I daresay I am out of humor myself. I
      think I had a little headache. Morbid, probably. I won&rsquo;t think of it any
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has occurred to me this morning that he may dislike being left by
      himself, while I am engaged in my household affairs. If this is the case,
      intensely as I hate her, utterly as I loathe the idea of putting her in
      command over my domestic dominions, I shall ask Miss Jillgall to take my
      place as housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was away to-day in the kitchen regions rather longer than usual. When I
      had done with my worries, Philip was not to be found. Maria, looking out
      of one of the bedroom windows instead of doing her work, had seen Mr.
      Dunboyne leave the house. It was possible that he had charged Miss
      Jillgall with a message for me. I asked if she was in her room. No; she,
      too, had gone out. It was a fine day, and Philip had no doubt taken a
      stroll&mdash;but he might have waited till I could join him. There were
      some orders to be given to the butcher and the green-grocer. I, too, left
      the house, hoping to get rid of some little discontent, caused by thinking
      of what had happened. Returning by the way of High Street&mdash;I declare
      I can hardly believe it even now&mdash;I did positively see Miss Jillgall
      coming out of a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop!
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction in which she turned prevented her from seeing me. She was
      quite unaware that I had discovered her; and I have said nothing about it
      since. But I noticed something unusual in the manner in which her
      watch-chain was hanging, and I asked her what o&rsquo;clock it was. She said,
      &ldquo;You have got your own watch.&rdquo; I told her my watch had stopped. &ldquo;So has
      mine,&rdquo; she said. There is no doubt about it now; she has pawned her watch.
      What for? She lives here for nothing, and she has not had a new dress
      since I have known her. Why does she want money?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had not returned when I got home. Another mysterious journey to
      London? No. After an absence of more than two hours, he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally enough, I asked what he had been about. He had been taking a
      long walk. For his health&rsquo;s sake? No: to think. To think of what? Well, I
      might be surprised to hear it, but his idle life was beginning to weigh on
      his spirits; he wanted employment. Had he thought of an employment? Not
      yet. Which way had he walked? Anyway: he had not noticed where he went.
      These replies were all made in a tone that offended me. Besides, I
      observed there was no dust on his boots (after a week of dry weather), and
      his walk of two hours did not appear to have heated or tired him. I took
      an opportunity of consulting Mrs. Tenbruggen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had anticipated that I should appeal to her opinion, as a woman of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not set down in detail what she said. Some of it humiliated me;
      and from some of it I recoiled. The expression of her opinion came to
      this. In the absence of experience, a certain fervor of temperament was
      essential to success in the art of fascinating men. Either my temperament
      was deficient, or my intellect overpowered it. It was natural that I
      should suppose myself to be as susceptible to the tender passion as the
      most excitable woman living. Delusion, my Helena, amiable delusion! Had I
      ever observed or had any friend told me that my pretty hands were cold
      hands? I had beautiful eyes, expressive of vivacity, of intelligence, of
      every feminine charm, except the one inviting charm that finds favor in
      the eyes of a man. She then entered into particulars, which I don&rsquo;t deny
      showed a true interest in helping me. I was ungrateful, sulky,
      self-opinionated. Dating from that day&rsquo;s talk with Mrs. Tenbruggen, my new
      friendship began to show signs of having caught a chill. But I did my best
      to follow her instructions&mdash;and failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps true that my temperament is overpowered by my intellect. Or
      it is possibly truer still that the fire in my heart, when it warms to
      love, is a fire that burns low. My belief is that I surprised Philip
      instead of charming him. He responded to my advances, but I felt that it
      was not done in earnest, not spontaneously. Had I any right to complain?
      Was I in earnest? Was I spontaneous? We were making love to each other
      under false pretenses. Oh, what a fool I was to ask for Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s
      advice!
    </p>
    <p>
      A humiliating doubt has come to me suddenly. Has his heart been inclining
      to Eunice again? After such a letter as she has written to him?
      Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Three events since yesterday, which I consider, trifling as they may be,
      intimations of something wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Miss Jillgall, who at one time was eager to take my place, has
      refused to relieve me of my housekeeping duties. Secondly, Philip has been
      absent again, on another long walk. Thirdly, when Philip returned,
      depressed and sulky, I caught Miss Jillgall looking at him with interest
      and pity visible in her skinny face. What do these things mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am beginning to doubt everybody. Not one of them, Philip included, cares
      for me&mdash;but I can frighten them, at any rate. Yesterday evening, I
      dropped on the floor as suddenly as if I had been shot: a fit of some
      sort. The doctor honestly declared that he was at a loss to account for
      it. He would have laid me under an eternal obligation if he had failed to
      bring me back to life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it is, I am more clever than the doctor. What brought the fit on is
      well known to me. Rage&mdash;furious, overpowering, deadly rage&mdash;was
      the cause. I am now in the cold-blooded state, which can look back at the
      event as composedly as if it had happened to some other girl. Suppose that
      girl had let her sweetheart know how she loved him as she had never let
      him know it before. Suppose she opened the door again the instant after
      she had left the room, eager, poor wretch, to say once more, for the
      fiftieth time, &ldquo;My angel, I love you!&rdquo; Suppose she found her angel
      standing with his back toward her, so that his face was reflected in the
      glass. And suppose she discovered in that face, so smiling and so sweet
      when his head had rested on her bosom only the moment before, the most
      hideous expression of disgust that features can betray. There could be no
      doubt of it; I had made my poor offering of love to a man who secretly
      loathed me. I wonder that I survived my sense of my own degradation. Well!
      I am alive; and I know him in his true character at last. Am I a woman who
      submits when an outrage is offered to her? What will happen next? Who
      knows? I am in a fine humor. What I have just written has set me laughing
      at myself. Helena Gracedieu has one merit at least&mdash;she is a very
      amusing person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, I am strong again, calm, wickedly capable of deceiving Mr.
      Philip Dunboyne, as he has deceived me. He has not the faintest suspicion
      that I have discovered him. I wish he had courage enough to kill somebody.
      How I should enjoy hiring the nearest window to the scaffold, and seeing
      him hanged!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall is in better spirits than ever. She is going to take a
      little holiday; and the cunning creature makes a mystery of it. &ldquo;Good-by,
      Miss Helena. I am going to stay for a day or two with a friend.&rdquo; What
      friend? Who cares?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night, I was wakeful. In the darkness a daring idea came to me.
      To-day, I have carried out the idea. Something has followed which is well
      worth entering in my Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the room at the usual hour for attending to my domestic affairs.
      The obstinate cook did me a service; she was insolent; she wanted to have
      her own way. I gave her her own way. In less than five minutes I was on
      the watch in the pantry, which has a view of the house door. My hat and my
      parasol were waiting for me on the table, in case of my going out, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more, I heard the door opened. Mr. Philip Dunboyne
      stepped out. He was going to take another of his long walks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed him to the street in which the cabs stand. He hired the first
      one on the rank, an open chaise; while I kept myself hidden in a shop
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he started on his drive, I hired a closed cab. &ldquo;Double your
      fare,&rdquo; I said to the driver, &ldquo;whatever it may be, if you follow that
      chaise cleverly, and do what I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and winked at me. A wicked-looking old fellow; just the man I
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed the chaise.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we had left the town behind us, the coachman began to drive more
      slowly. In my ignorance, I asked what this change in the pace meant. He
      pointed with his whip to the open road and to the chaise in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we keep too near the gentleman, miss, he has only got to look back,
      and he&rsquo;ll see we are following him. The safe thing to do is to let the
      chaise get on a bit. We can&rsquo;t lose sight of it, out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had felt inclined to trust in the driver&rsquo;s experience, and he had
      already justified my confidence in him. This encouraged me to consult his
      opinion on a matter of some importance to my present interests. I could
      see the necessity of avoiding discovery when we had followed the chaise to
      its destination; but I was totally at a loss to know how it could be done.
      My wily old man was ready with his advice the moment I asked for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever the chaise stops, miss, we must drive past it as if we were
      going somewhere else. I shall notice the place while we go by; and you
      will please sit back in the corner of the cab so that the gentleman can&rsquo;t
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, miss, I shall pull up, wherever it may be, out of sight of the
      driver of the chaise. He bears an excellent character, I don&rsquo;t deny it;
      but I&rsquo;ve known him for years&mdash;and we had better not trust him. I
      shall tell you where the gentleman stopped; and you will go back to the
      place (on foot, of course), and see for yourself what&rsquo;s to be done,
      specially if there happens to be a lady in the case. No offense, miss;
      it&rsquo;s in my experience that there&rsquo;s generally a lady in the case. Anyhow,
      you can judge for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll know where to find me waiting when
      you want me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose something happens,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t lose my head, miss, whatever happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well, coachman; but I have only your word for it.&rdquo; In the
      irritable state of my mind, the man&rsquo;s confident way of thinking annoyed
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, my young lady, you&rsquo;ve got (if I may say so) what
      they call a guarantee. When I was a young man, I drove a cab in London for
      ten years. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that you have learned deceit in the
      wicked ways of the great city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took this as a compliment. &ldquo;Thank you, miss. That&rsquo;s it exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long drive, or so it seemed to my impatience, we passed the chaise
      drawn up at a lonely house, separated by a front garden from the road. In
      two or three minutes more, we stopped where the road took a turn, and
      descended to lower ground. The farmhouse which we had left behind us was
      known to the driver. He led the way to a gate at the side of the road, and
      opened it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your place, miss,&rdquo; he said slyly, &ldquo;the private way back is the way I
      should wish to take. Try it by the fields. Turn to the right when you have
      passed the barn, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself at the back of the house.&rdquo; He
      stopped, and looked at his big silver watch. &ldquo;Half-past twelve,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;the Chawbacons&mdash;I mean the farmhouse servants, miss&mdash;will be at
      their dinner. All in your favor, so far. If the dog happens to be loose,
      don&rsquo;t forget that his name&rsquo;s Grinder; call him by his name, and pat him
      before he has time enough to think, and he&rsquo;ll let you be. When you want
      me, here you&rsquo;ll find me waiting for orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked back as I crossed the field. The driver was sitting on the gate,
      smoking his pipe, and the horse was nibbling the grass at the roadside.
      Two happy animals, without a burden on their minds!
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing the barn, I saw nothing of the dog. Far or near, no living
      creature appeared; the servants must have been at dinner, as the coachman
      had foreseen. Arriving at a wooden fence, I opened a gate in it, and found
      myself on a bit of waste ground. On my left, there was a large duck-pond.
      On my right, I saw the fowl-house and the pigstyes. Before me was a high
      impenetrable hedge; and at some distance behind it&mdash;an orchard or a
      garden, as I supposed, filling the intermediate space&mdash;rose the back
      of the house. I made for the shelter of the hedge, in the fear that some
      one might approach a window and see me. Once sheltered from observation, I
      might consider what I should do next. It was impossible to doubt that this
      was the house in which Eunice was living. Neither could I fail to conclude
      that Philip had tried to persuade her to see him, on those former
      occasions when he told me he had taken a long walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I crouched behind the hedge, I heard voices approaching on the other
      side of it. At last fortune had befriended me. The person speaking at the
      moment was Miss Jillgall; and the person who answered her was Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, dear Mr. Philip, you don&rsquo;t quite understand my sweet
      Euneece. Honorable, high minded, delicate in her feelings, and, oh, so
      unselfish! I don&rsquo;t want to alarm you, but when she hears you have been
      deceiving Helena&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Miss Jillgall, you are so provoking! I have not been
      deceiving Helena. Haven&rsquo;t I told you what discouraging answers I got, when
      I went to see the Governor? Haven&rsquo;t I shown you Eunice&rsquo;s reply to my
      letter? You can&rsquo;t have forgotten it already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have. Why should I remember it? Don&rsquo;t I know poor Euneece was
      in your mind, all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong again! Eunice was not in my mind all the time. I was hurt&mdash;I
      was offended by the cruel manner in which she had treated me. And what was
      the consequence? So far was I from deceiving Helena&mdash;she rose in my
      estimation by comparison with her sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come, Mr. Philip! that won&rsquo;t do. Helena rising in anybody&rsquo;s
      estimation? Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh as much as you like, Miss Jillgall, you won&rsquo;t laugh away the facts.
      Helena loved me; Helena was true to me. Don&rsquo;t be hard on a poor fellow who
      is half distracted. What a man finds he can do on one day, he finds he
      can&rsquo;t do on another. Try to understand that a change does sometimes come
      over one&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, Mr. Philip, that&rsquo;s just what I have been understanding all
      the time! I know your mind as well as you know it yourself. You can&rsquo;t
      forget my sweet Euneece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I tried to forget her! On my word of honor as a gentleman, I
      tried to forget her, in justice to Helena. Is it my fault that I failed?
      Eunice was in my mind, as you said just now. Oh, my friend&mdash;for you
      are my friend, I am sure&mdash;persuade her to see me, if it&rsquo;s only for a
      minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Was there ever a man&rsquo;s mind in such a state of confusion as this! First,
      I rise in his precious estimation, and Eunice drops. Then Eunice rises,
      and I drop. Idiot! Mischievous idiot! Even Selina seemed to be disgusted
      with him, when she spoke next.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Philip, you are hard and unreasonable. I have tried to persuade her,
      and I have made my darling cry. Nothing you can say will induce me to
      distress her again. Go back, you very undetermined man&mdash;go back to
      your Helena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say too late. If I could have married Helena when I first went to stay
      in the house, I might have faced the sacrifice. As it is, I can&rsquo;t endure
      her; and (I tell you this in confidence) she has herself to thank for what
      has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that really true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk of her! Persuade Eunice to see me. I shall come back
      again, and again, and again till you bring her to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. If she changes her mind, I will bring her
      with pleasure. If she still shrinks from it, I regard Euneece&rsquo;s feelings
      as sacred. Take my advice; don&rsquo;t press her. Leave her time to think of
      you, and to pity you&mdash;and that true heart may be yours again, if you
      are worthy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy of it? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, my young friend, that you won&rsquo;t go back to Helena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to <i>her</i>? I would cut my throat if I thought myself capable
      of doing it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she set you against her? Did the wretch quarrel with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been better for both of us if she had done that. Oh, her
      fulsome endearments! What a contrast to the charming modesty of Eunice! If
      I was rich, I would make it worth the while of the first poor fellow I
      could find to rid me of Helena by marrying her. I don&rsquo;t like saying such a
      thing of a woman, but if you will have the truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Philip&mdash;and what is the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helena disgusts me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. HELENA&rsquo;S DIARY RESUMED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So it was all settled between them. Philip is to throw me away, like one
      of his bad cigars, for this unanswerable reason: &ldquo;Helena disgusts me.&rdquo; And
      he is to persuade Eunice to take my place, and be his wife. Yes! if I let
      him do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard no more of their talk. With that last, worst outrage burning in my
      memory, I left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way back to the carriage, the dog met me. Truly, a grand creature. I
      called him by his name, and patted him. He licked my hand. Something made
      me speak to him. I said: &ldquo;If I was to tell you to tear Mr. Philip Dunboyne
      to pieces, would you do it?&rdquo; The great good-natured brute held out his paw
      to shake hands. Well! well! I was not an object of disgust to the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the coachman was startled, when he saw me again. He said something, I
      did not know what it was; and he produced a pocket-flask, containing some
      spirits, I suppose. Perhaps he thought I was going to faint. He little
      knew me. I told him to drive back to the place at which I had hired the
      cab, and earn his money. He earned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On getting home, I found Mrs. Tenbruggen walking up and down the
      dining-room, deep in thought. She was startled when we first confronted
      each other. &ldquo;You look dreadfully ill,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered that I had been out for a little exercise, and had
      over-fatigued myself; and then changed the subject. &ldquo;Does my father seem
      to improve under your treatment?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very far from it, my dear. I promised that I would try what Massage would
      do for him, and I find myself compelled to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It excites him dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been talking wildly of events in his past life. His brain is in
      some condition which is beyond my powers of investigation. He pointed to a
      cabinet in his room, and said his past life was locked up there. I asked
      if I should unlock it. He shook with fear; he said I should let out the
      ghost of his dead brother-in-law. Have you any idea of what he meant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabinet was full of old letters. I could tell her that&mdash;and could
      tell her no more. I had never heard of his brother-in-law. Another of his
      delusions, no doubt. &ldquo;Did you ever hear him speak,&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen went
      on, &ldquo;of a place called Low Lanes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited for my reply to this last inquiry with an appearance of anxiety
      that surprised me. I had never heard him speak of Low Lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any particular interest in the place?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went away to attend on a patient. I retired to my bedroom, and opened
      my Diary. Again and again, I read that remarkable story of the intended
      poisoning, and of the manner in which it had ended. I sat thinking over
      this romance in real life till I was interrupted by the announcement of
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Dunboyne had returned. In Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s absence we were alone
      at the table. My appetite was gone. I made a pretense of eating, and
      another pretense of being glad to see my devoted lover. I talked to him in
      the prettiest manner. As a hypocrite, he thoroughly matched me; he was
      gallant, he was amusing. If baseness like ours had been punishable by the
      law, a prison was the right place for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen came in again after dinner, still not quite easy about my
      health. &ldquo;How flushed you are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me feel your pulse.&rdquo; I
      laughed, and left her with Mr. Philip Dunboyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing my father&rsquo;s door, I looked in, anxious to see if he was in the
      excitable state which Mrs. Tenbruggen had described. Yes; the effect which
      she had produced on him&mdash;how, she knows best&mdash;had not passed
      away yet: he was still talking. The attendant told me it had gone on for
      hours together. On my approaching his chair, he called out: &ldquo;Which are
      you? Eunice or Helena?&rdquo; When I had answered him, he beckoned me to come
      nearer. &ldquo;I am getting stronger every minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will go
      traveling to-morrow, and see the place where you were born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where had I been born? He had never told me where. Had he mentioned the
      place in Mrs. Tenbruggen&rsquo;s hearing? I asked the attendant if he had been
      present while she was in the room. Yes; he had remained at his post; he
      had also heard the allusion to the place with the odd name. Had Mr.
      Gracedieu said anything more about that place? Nothing more; the poor
      Minister&rsquo;s mind had wandered off to other things. He was wandering now.
      Sometimes, he was addressing his congregation; sometimes, he wondered what
      they would give him for supper; sometimes, he talked of the flowers in the
      garden. And then he looked at me, and frowned, and said I prevented him
      from thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my bedroom, and opened my Diary, and read the story again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the poison of which that resolute young wife proposed to make use
      something that acted slowly, and told the doctors nothing if they looked
      for it after death?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it be running too great a risk to show the story to the doctor, and
      try to get a little valuable information in that way? It would be useless.
      He would make some feeble joke; he would say, girls and poisons are not
      fit company for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I might discover what I want to know in another way. I might call on
      the doctor, after he has gone out on his afternoon round of visits, and
      might tell the servant I would wait for his master&rsquo;s return. Nobody would
      be in my way; I might get at the medical literature in the
      consulting-room, and find the information for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at my door interrupted me in the midst of my plans. Mrs.
      Tenbruggen again!&mdash;still in a fidgety state of feeling on the subject
      of my health. &ldquo;Which is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pain of body, my dear, or pain of
      mind? I am anxious about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Elizabeth, your sympathy is thrown away on me. As I have told you
      already, I am over-tired&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was relieved to hear that I had no mental troubles to complain of.
      &ldquo;Fatigue,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;sets itself right with rest. Did you take a very
      long walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond the limits of the town, of course? Philip has been taking a walk
      in the country, too. He doesn&rsquo;t say that he met you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These clever people sometimes overreach themselves. How she suggested it
      to me, I cannot pretend to have discovered. But I did certainly suspect
      that she had led Philip, while they were together downstairs, into saying
      to her what he had already said to Miss Jillgall. I was so angry that I
      tried to pump my excellent friend, as she had been trying to pump me&mdash;a
      vulgar expression, but vulgar writing is such a convenient way of writing
      sometimes. My first attempt to entrap the Masseuse failed completely. She
      coolly changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I interrupted you in writing?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to my Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was idling over what I have written already&mdash;an extraordinary
      story which I copied from a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pushed the open Diary across the table. If I was the object of any
      suspicions which she wanted to confirm, it would be curious to see if the
      poisoning story helped her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piece of family history,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I
      think you will agree with me that it is really interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to read. As she went on, not all her power of controlling
      herself could prevent her from turning pale. This change of color (in such
      a woman) a little alarmed me. When a girl is devoured by deadly hatred of
      a man, does the feeling show itself to other persons in her face? I must
      practice before the glass and train my face into a trustworthy state of
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coarse melodrama!&rdquo; Mrs. Tenbruggen declared. &ldquo;Mere sensation. No analysis
      of character. A made-up story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well made up, surely?&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you.&rdquo; Her voice was not quite so steady as usual. She
      asked suddenly if my clock was right&mdash;and declared that she should be
      late for an appointment. On taking leave she pressed my hand strongly&mdash;eyed
      me with distrustful attention and said, very emphatically: &ldquo;Take care of
      yourself, Helena; pray take care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid I did a very foolish thing when I showed her the poisoning
      story. Has it helped the wily old creature to look into my inmost
      thoughts?
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, Miss Jillgall returned, looking hideously healthy and spitefully
      cheerful. Although she tried to conceal it, while I was present, I could
      see that Philip had recovered his place in her favor. After what he had
      said to her behind the hedge at the farm, she would be relieved from all
      fear of my becoming his wife, and would joyfully anticipate his marriage
      to Eunice. There are thoughts in me which I don&rsquo;t set down in my book. I
      only say: We shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, I decided on visiting the doctor. The servant was quite
      sorry for me when he answered the door. His master had just left the house
      for a round of visits. I said I would wait. The servant was afraid I
      should find waiting very tedious. I reminded him that I could go away if I
      found it tedious. At last, the polite old man left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the consulting-room, and read the backs of the medical books
      ranged round the walls, and found a volume that interested me. There was
      such curious information in it that I amused myself by making extracts,
      using the first sheets of paper that I could find. They had printed
      directions at the top, which showed that the doctor was accustomed to
      write his prescriptions on them. We had many, too many, of his
      prescriptions in our house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant&rsquo;s doubts of my patience proved to have been well founded. I
      got tired of waiting, and went home before the doctor returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      From morning to night, nothing has been seen of Mrs. Tenbruggen to-day.
      Nor has any apology for her neglect of us been received, fond as she is of
      writing little notes. Has that story in my Diary driven her away? Let me
      see what to-morrow may bring forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day has brought forth&mdash;nothing. Mrs. Tenbruggen still keeps away
      from us. It looks as if my Diary had something to do with the mystery of
      her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not in good spirits to-day. My nerves&mdash;if I have such things,
      which is more than I know by my own experience&mdash;have been a little
      shaken by a horrid dream. The medical information, which my thirst for
      knowledge absorbed in the doctor&rsquo;s consulting-room, turned traitor&mdash;armed
      itself with the grotesque horrors of nightmare&mdash;and so thoroughly
      frightened me that I was on the point of being foolish enough to destroy
      my notes. I thought better of it, and my notes are safe under lock and
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Dunboyne is trying to pave the way for his flight from this
      house. He speaks of friends in London, whose interest will help him to
      find the employment which is the object of his ambition. &ldquo;In a few days
      more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall ask for leave of absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of looking at me, his eyes wandered to the window; his fingers
      played restlessly with his watch-chain while he spoke. I thought I would
      give him a chance, a last chance, of making the atonement that he owes to
      me. This shows shameful weakness, on my part. Does my own resolution
      startle me? Or does the wretch appeal&mdash;to what? To my pity? It cannot
      be my love; I am positively sure that I hate him. Well, I am not the first
      girl who had been an unanswerable riddle to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any other motive for your departure?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other motive can there be?&rdquo; he replied. I put what I had to say to
      him in plainer words still. &ldquo;Tell me, Philip, are you beginning to wish
      that you were a free man again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still prevaricated. Was this because he is afraid of me, or because he
      is not quite brute enough to insult me to my face? I tried again for the
      third and last time. I almost put the words into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you have been out of temper lately,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have not been
      your own kinder and better self. Is this the right interpretation of the
      change that I think I see in you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered: &ldquo;I have not been very well lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no more to be said; I turned away to leave the room. He followed
      me to the door. After a momentary hesitation, he made the attempt to kiss
      me. I only looked at him&mdash;he drew back from me in silence. I left the
      new Judas, standing alone, while the shades of evening began to gather
      over the room.

      CHAPTER LVIII. DANGER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything of importance happens, I trust to you to write an account of
      it, and to send the writing to me. I will come to you at once, if I see
      reason to believe that my presence is required.&rdquo; Those lines, in your last
      kind reply to me, rouse my courage, dear Mr. Governor, and sharpen the
      vigilance which has always been one of the strong points in my character.
      Every suspicious circumstance which occurs in this house will be (so to
      speak) seized on by my pen, and will find itself (so to speak again)
      placed on its trial, before your unerring judgment! Let the wicked
      tremble! I mention no names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up my narrative where it came to an end when I last wrote, I have
      to say a word first on the subject of my discoveries, in regard to
      Philip&rsquo;s movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advertisement of a private inquiry office, which I read in a
      newspaper, put the thing into my head. I provided myself with money to pay
      the expenses by&mdash;I blush while I write it&mdash;pawning my watch.
      This humiliation of my poor self has been rewarded by success. Skilled
      investigation has proved that our young man has come to his senses again,
      exactly as I supposed. On each occasion when he was suspiciously absent
      from the house, he has been followed to the farm. I have been staying
      there myself for a day or two, in the hope of persuading Eunice to relent.
      The hope has not yet been realized. But Philip&rsquo;s devotion, assisted by my
      influence, will yet prevail. Let me not despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Helena knows positively that she has lost her wicked hold on
      Philip I cannot say. It seems hardly possible that she could have made the
      discovery just yet. The one thing of which I am certain is, that she looks
      like a fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip has wisely taken my advice, and employed pious fraud. He will get
      away from the wretch, who has tempted him once and may tempt him again,
      under pretense of using the interest of his friends in London to find a
      place under Government. He has not been very well for the last day or two,
      and the execution of our project is in consequence delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have news of Mrs. Tenbruggen which will, I think, surprise you.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has kept away from us in a most unaccountable manner. I called on her
      at the hotel, and heard she was engaged with her lawyer. On the next day,
      she suddenly returned to her old habits, and paid the customary visit. I
      observed a similar alteration in her state of feeling. She is now coldly
      civil to Helena; and she asks after Eunice with a maternal interest
      touching to see&mdash;I said to her: &ldquo;Elizabeth, you appear to have
      changed your opinion of the two girls, since I saw you.&rdquo; She answered,
      with a delightful candor which reminded me of old times: &ldquo;Completely!&rdquo; I
      said: &ldquo;A woman of your intellectual caliber, dear, doesn&rsquo;t change her mind
      without a good reason for it.&rdquo; Elizabeth cordially agreed with me. I
      ventured to be a little more explicit: &ldquo;You have no doubt made some
      interesting discovery.&rdquo; Elizabeth agreed again; and I ventured again: &ldquo;I
      suppose I may not ask what the discovery is?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Selina, you may not
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is curious; but it is nothing to what I have got to tell you next.
      Just as I was longing to take her to my bosom again as my friend and
      confidante, Elizabeth has disappeared. And, alas! alas! there is a reason
      for it which no sympathetic person can dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just received some overwhelming news, in the form of a neat parcel,
      addressed to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been a scandal at the hotel. That monster in human form,
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband, is aware of his wife&rsquo;s professional fame, has heard
      of the large sums of money which she earns as the greatest living
      professor of massage, has been long on the lookout for her, and has
      discovered her at last. He has not only forced his way into her
      sitting-room at the hotel; he insists on her living with him again; her
      money being the attraction, it is needless to say. If she refuses, he
      threatens her with the law, the barbarous law, which, to use his own
      coarse expression, will &ldquo;restore his conjugal rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this I gather from the narrative of my unhappy friend, which forms one
      of the two inclosures in her parcel. She has already made her escape. Ha!
      the man doesn&rsquo;t live who can circumvent Elizabeth. The English Court of
      Law isn&rsquo;t built which can catch her when she roams the free and glorious
      Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vastness of this amazing woman&rsquo;s mind is what I must pause to admire.
      In the frightful catastrophe that has befallen her, she can still think of
      Philip and Euneece. She is eager to hear of their marriage, and renounces
      Helena with her whole heart. &ldquo;I too was deceived by that cunning young
      Woman,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;Beware of her, Selina. Unless I am much mistaken, she
      is going to end badly. Take care of Philip, take care of Euneece. If you
      want help, apply at once to my favorite hero in real life, The Governor.&rdquo;
       I don&rsquo;t presume to correct Elizabeth&rsquo;s language. I should have called you
      The idol of the Women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second inclosure contains, as I suppose, a wedding present. It is
      carefully sealed&mdash;it feels no bigger than an ordinary letter&mdash;and
      it contains an inscription which your highly-cultivated intelligence may
      be able to explain. I copy it as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be inclosed in another envelope, addressed to Mr. Dunboyne the elder,
      at Percy&rsquo;s Private Hotel, London, and delivered by a trustworthy
      messenger, on the day when Mr. Philip Dunboyne is married to Miss Eunice
      Gracedieu. Placed meanwhile under the care of Miss Selina Jillgall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why is this mysterious letter to be sent to Philip&rsquo;s father? I wonder
      whether that circumstance will puzzle you as it has puzzled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have kept my report back, so as to send you the last news relating to
      Philip&rsquo;s state of health. To my great regret, his illness seems to have
      made a serious advance since yesterday. When I ask if he is in pain, he
      says: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly pain; I feel as if I was sinking. Sometimes I am
      giddy; and sometimes I find myself feeling thirsty and sick.&rdquo; I have no
      opportunity of looking after him as I could wish; for Helena insists on
      nursing him, assisted by the housemaid. Maria is a very good girl in her
      way, but too stupid to be of much use. If he is not better to-morrow, I
      shall insist on sending for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is no better; and he wishes to have medical help. Helena doesn&rsquo;t seem
      to understand his illness. It was not until Philip had insisted on seeing
      him that she consented to send for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      You had some talk with this experienced physician when you were here, and
      you know what a clever man he is. When I tell you that he hesitates to say
      what is the matter with Philip, you will feel as much alarmed as I do. I
      will wait to send this to the post until I can write in a more definite
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days more have passed. The doctor has put two very strange questions
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked, first, if there was anybody staying with us besides the regular
      members of the household. I said we had no visitor. He wanted to know,
      next, if Mr. Philip Dunboyne had made any enemies since he has been living
      in our town. I said none that I knew of&mdash;and I took the liberty of
      asking what he meant. He answered to this, that he has a few more
      inquiries to make, and that he will tell me what he means to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      For God&rsquo;s sake come here as soon as you possibly can. The whole burden is
      thrown on me&mdash;and I am quite unequal to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received the doctor to-day in the drawing-room. To my amazement, he
      begged leave to speak with me in the garden. When I asked why, he
      answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have a listener at the door. Come out on the
      lawn, where we can be sure that we are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were in the garden, he noticed that I was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse your courage, Miss Jillgall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the Minister&rsquo;s helpless
      state there is nobody whom I can speak to but yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to remind him that he might speak to Helena as well as to
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked as black as thunder when I mentioned her name. All he said was,
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; But, oh, if you had heard his voice&mdash;and he so gentle and
      sweet-tempered at other times&mdash;you would have felt, as I did, that he
      had Helena in his mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen to this,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Everything that my art can do for Mr.
      Philip Dunboyne, while I am at his bedside, is undone while I am away by
      some other person. He is worse to-day than I have seen him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, do you think he will die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will certainly die unless the right means are taken to save him, and
      taken at once. It is my duty not to flinch from telling you the truth. I
      have made a discovery since yesterday which satisfies me that I am right.
      Somebody is trying to poison Mr. Dunboyne; and somebody will succeed
      unless he is removed from this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am a poor feeble creature. The doctor caught me, or I should have
      dropped on the grass. It was not a fainting-fit. I only shook and shivered
      so that I was too weak to stand up. Encouraged by the doctor, I recovered
      sufficiently to be able to ask him where Philip was to be taken to. He
      said: &ldquo;To the hospital. No poisoner can follow my patient there. Persuade
      him to let me take him away, when I call again in an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I could hold a pen, I sent a telegram to you. Pray, pray come
      by the earliest train. I also telegraphed to old Mr. Dunboyne, at the
      hotel in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for me to face Helena; I own I was afraid. The cook
      kindly went upstairs to see who was in Philip&rsquo;s room. It was the
      housemaid&rsquo;s turn to look after him for a while. I went instantly to his
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no persuading him to allow himself to be taken to the hospital.
      &ldquo;I am dying,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you have any pity for me, send for Euneece. Let
      me see her once more, let me hear her say that she forgives me, before I
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated. It was too terrible to think of Euneece in the same house
      with her sister. Her life might be in danger! Philip gave me a look, a
      dreadful ghastly look. &ldquo;If you refuse,&rdquo; he said wildly, &ldquo;the grave won&rsquo;t
      hold me. I&rsquo;ll haunt you for the rest of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall hear that you are ill,&rdquo; I answered&mdash;and ran out of the
      room before he could speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I had promised to write, I did write. But, placed between Euneece&rsquo;s
      danger and Philip&rsquo;s danger, my heart was all for Euneece. Would Helena
      spare her, if she came to Philip&rsquo;s bedside? In such terror as I never felt
      before in my life, I added a word more, entreating her not to leave the
      farm. I promised to keep her regularly informed on the subject of Philip&rsquo;s
      illness; and I mentioned that I expected the Governor to return to us
      immediately. &ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;without his advice.&rdquo; My letter having
      been completed, I sent the cook away with it, in a chaise. She belonged to
      the neighborhood, and she knew the farmhouse well. Nearly two hours
      afterward, I heard the chaise stop at the door, and ran out, impatient to
      hear how my sweet girl had received my letter. God help us all! When I
      opened the door, the first person whom I saw was Euneece herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX. DEFENSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One surprise followed another, after I had encountered Euneece at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my fondness had excused her for setting the well-meant advice in my
      letter at defiance, I was conscious of expecting to see her in tears;
      eager, distressingly eager, to hear what hope there might be of Philip&rsquo;s
      recovery. I saw no tears, I heard no inquiries. She was pale, and quiet,
      and silent. Not a word fell from her when we met, not a word when she
      kissed me, not a word when she led the way into the nearest room&mdash;the
      dining-room. It was only when we were shut in together that she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is Philip&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of wanting to know how he was, she desired to know where he was! I
      pointed toward the back dining-room, which had been made into a bedroom
      for Philip. He had chosen it himself, when he first came to stay with us,
      because the window opened into the garden, and he could slip out and smoke
      at any hour of the day or night, when he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is with him now?&rdquo; was the next strange thing this sadly-changed girl
      said to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria is taking her turn,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;she assists in nursing Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is&mdash;?&rdquo; Euneece got no further than that. Her breath quickened,
      her color faded away. I had seen people look as she was looking now, when
      they suffered under some sudden pain. Before I could offer to help her,
      she rallied, and went on: &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;is the other nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Helena?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the Poisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I remind you, dear Mr. Governor, that my letter had carefully
      concealed from her the horrible discovery made by the doctor, your
      imagination will picture my state of mind. She saw that I was overpowered.
      Her sweet nature, so strangely frozen up thus far, melted at last. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know what I have heard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what thoughts
      have been roused in me.&rdquo; She left her chair, and sat on my knee with the
      familiarity of the dear old times, and took the letter that I had written
      to her from her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at it yourself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell me if anybody could read it,
      and not see that you were concealing something. My dear, I have driven
      round by the doctor&rsquo;s house&mdash;I have seen him&mdash;I have persuaded
      him, or perhaps I ought to say surprised him, into telling me the truth.
      But the kind old man is obstinate. He wouldn&rsquo;t believe me when I told him
      I was on my way here to save Philip&rsquo;s life. He said: &lsquo;My child, you will
      only put your own life in jeopardy. If I had not seen that danger, I
      should never have told you of the dreadful state of things at home. Go
      back to the good people at the farm, and leave the saving of Philip to
      me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was right, Euneece, entirely right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, he was wrong. I begged him to come here, and judge for himself;
      and I ask you to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obstinate. &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;Go back to the farm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see Philip?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard some insolent men say that women are like cats. If they mean
      that we do, figuratively speaking, scratch at times, I am afraid they are
      not altogether wrong. An irresistible impulse made me say to poor Euneece:
      &ldquo;This is a change indeed, since you refused to receive Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no change in the circumstances?&rdquo; she asked sadly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he ill
      and in danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged her to forgive me; I said I meant no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him up to my sister,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;when I believed that his
      happiness depended, not on me, but on her. I take him back to myself, when
      he is at the mercy of a demon who threatens his life. Come, Selina, let us
      go to Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arm round me, and made me get up from my chair. I was so
      easily persuaded by her, that the fear of what Helena&rsquo;s jealousy and
      Helena&rsquo;s anger might do was scarcely present in my thoughts. The door of
      communication was locked on the side of the bedchamber. I went into the
      hall, to enter Philip&rsquo;s room by the other door. She followed, waiting
      behind me. I heard what passed between them when Maria went out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Miss Gracedieu?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resting upstairs, miss, in her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the clock, and tell me when you expect her to come down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to call her, miss, in ten minutes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait in the dining-room, Maria, till I come back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She joined me. I held the door open for her to go into Philip&rsquo;s room. It
      was not out of curiosity; the feeling that urged me was sympathy, when I
      waited a moment to see their first meeting. She bent over the poor,
      pallid, trembling, suffering man, and raised him in her arms, and laid his
      head on her bosom. &ldquo;My Philip!&rdquo; She murmured those words in a kiss. I
      closed the door, I had a good cry; and, oh, how it comforted me!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only a minute to spare when she came out of the room. Maria was
      waiting for her. Euneece said, as quietly as ever: &ldquo;Go and call Miss
      Gracedieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at her, and saw&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what. Maria became
      alarmed. But she went up the stairs, and returned in haste to tell us that
      her young mistress was coming down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint rustling of Helena&rsquo;s dress as she left her room reached us in
      the silence. I remained at the open door of the dining-room, and Maria
      approached and stood near me. We were both frightened. Euneece stepped
      forward, and stood on the mat at the foot of the stairs, waiting. Her back
      was toward me; I could only see that she was as still as a statue. The
      rustling of the dress came nearer. Oh, heavens! what was going to happen?
      My teeth chattered in my head; I held by Maria&rsquo;s shoulder. Drops of
      perspiration showed themselves on the girl&rsquo;s forehead; she stared in
      vacant terror at the slim little figure, posted firm and still on the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena turned the corner of the stairs, and waited a moment on the last
      landing, and saw her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. Helena descended, until she reached the last stair but
      one. There, she stopped. Her staring eyes grew large and wild; her hand
      shook as she stretched it out, feeling for the banister; she staggered as
      she caught at it, and held herself up. The silence was still unbroken.
      Something in me, stronger than myself, drew my steps along the hall nearer
      and nearer to the stair, till I could see the face which had struck that
      murderous wretch with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! it was not my sweet girl; it was a horrid transformation of her. I saw
      a fearful creature, with glittering eyes that threatened some unimaginable
      vengeance. Her lips were drawn back; they showed her clinched teeth. A
      burning red flush dyed her face. The hair of her head rose, little by
      little, slowly. And, most dreadful sight of all, she seemed, in the
      stillness of the house, to be <i>listening to something</i>. If I could
      have moved, I should have fled to the first place of refuge I could find.
      If I could have raised my voice, I should have cried for help. I could do
      neither the one nor the other. I could only look, look, look; held by the
      horror of it with a hand of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena must have roused her courage, and resisted her terror. I heard her
      speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, steadily, in a whisper, Euneece made that reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena tried once more&mdash;still fighting against her own terror: I knew
      it by the trembling of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me by,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;I am on my way to Philip&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never enter Philip&rsquo;s room again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will stop me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken in the same steady whisper throughout&mdash;but now she
      moved. I saw her set her foot on the first stair. I saw the horrid glitter
      in her eyes flash close into Helena&rsquo;s face. I heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoner, go back to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silent and shuddering, Helena shrank away from her&mdash;daunted by her
      glittering eyes; mastered by her lifted hand pointing up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena slowly ascended till she reached the landing. She turned and looked
      down; she tried to speak. The pointing hand struck her dumb, and drove her
      up the next flight of stairs. She was lost to view. Only the small
      rustling sound of the dress was to be heard, growing fainter and fainter;
      then an interval of stillness; then the noise of a door opened and closed
      again; then no sound more&mdash;but a change to be seen: the transformed
      creature was crouching on her knees, still and silent, her face covered by
      her hands. I was afraid to approach her; I was afraid to speak to her.
      After a time, she rose. Suddenly, swiftly, with her head turned away from
      me, she opened the door of Philip&rsquo;s room&mdash;and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round. There was only Maria in the lonely hall. Shall I try to
      tell you what my sensations were? It may sound strangely, but it is true&mdash;I
      felt like a sleeper, who has half-awakened from a dream.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX. DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little later, on that eventful day, when I was most in need of all that
      your wisdom and kindness could do to guide me, came the telegram which
      announced that you were helpless under an attack of gout. As soon as I had
      in some degree got over my disappointment, I remembered having told
      Euneece in my letter that I expected her kind old friend to come to us.
      With the telegram in my hand I knocked softly at Philip&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice that bade me come in was the gentle voice that I knew so well.
      Philip was sleeping. There, by his bedside, with his hand resting in her
      hand, was Euneece, so completely restored to her own sweet self that I
      could hardly believe what I had seen, not an hour since. She talked of
      you, when I showed her your message, with affectionate interest and
      regret. Look back, my admirable friend, at what I have written on the two
      or three pages which precede this, and explain the astounding contrast if
      you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was left alone to watch by Philip, while Euneece went away to see her
      father. Soon afterward, Maria took my place; I had been sent for to the
      next room to receive the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked care-worn and grieved. I said I was afraid he had brought bad
      news with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst possible news,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A terrible exposure threatens
      this family, and I am powerless to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then asked me to remember the day when I had been surprised by the
      singular questions which he had put to me, and when he had engaged to
      explain himself after he had made some inquiries. Why, and how, he had set
      those inquiries on foot was what he had now to tell. I will repeat what he
      said, in his own words, as nearly as I can remember them. While he was in
      attendance on Philip, he had observed symptoms which made him suspect that
      Digitalis had been given to the young man, in doses often repeated. Cases
      of attempted poisoning by this medicine were so rare, that he felt bound
      to put his suspicions to the test by going round among the chemists&rsquo;s
      shops&mdash;excepting of course the shop at which his own prescriptions
      were made up&mdash;and asking if they had lately dispensed any preparation
      of Digitalis, ordered perhaps in a larger quantity than usual. At the
      second shop he visited, the chemist laughed. &ldquo;Why, doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have
      you forgotten your own prescription?&rdquo; After this, the prescription was
      asked for, and produced. It was on the paper used by the doctor&mdash;paper
      which had his address printed at the top, and a notice added, telling
      patients who came to consult him for the second time to bring their
      prescriptions with them. Then, there followed in writing: &ldquo;Tincture of
      Digitalis, one ounce&rdquo;&mdash;with his signature at the end, not badly
      imitated, but a forgery nevertheless. The chemist noticed the effect which
      this discovery had produced on the doctor, and asked if that was his
      signature. He could hardly, as an honest man, have asserted that a forgery
      was a signature of his own writing. So he made the true reply, and asked
      who had presented the prescription. The chemist called to his assistant to
      come forward. &ldquo;Did you tell me that you knew, by sight, the young lady who
      brought this prescription?&rdquo; The assistant admitted it. &ldquo;Did you tell me
      she was Miss Helena Gracedieu?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you sure of not having made
      any mistake?&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo; The chemist then said: &ldquo;I myself supplied the
      Tincture of Digitalis, and the young lady paid for it, and took it away
      with her. You have had all the information that I can give you, sir; and I
      may now ask, if you can throw any light on the matter.&rdquo; Our good friend
      thought of the poor Minister, so sorely afflicted, and of the famous name
      so sincerely respected in the town and in the country round, and said he
      could not undertake to give an immediate answer. The chemist was
      excessively angry. &ldquo;You know as well as I do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Digitalis,
      given in certain doses, is a poison, and you cannot deny that I honestly
      believed myself to be dispensing your prescription. While you are
      hesitating to give me an answer, my character may suffer; I may be
      suspected myself.&rdquo; He ended in declaring he should consult his lawyer. The
      doctor went home, and questioned his servant. The man remembered the day
      of Miss Helena&rsquo;s visit in the afternoon, and the intention that she
      expressed of waiting for his master&rsquo;s return. He had shown her into the
      parlor which opened into the consulting-room. No other visitor was in the
      house at that time, or had arrived during the rest of the day. The
      doctor&rsquo;s own experience, when he got home, led him to conclude that Helena
      had gone into the consulting-room. He had entered that room, for the
      purpose of writing some prescriptions, and had found the leaves of paper
      that he used diminished in number. After what he had heard, and what he
      had discovered (to say nothing of what he suspected), it occurred to him
      to look along the shelves of his medical library. He found a volume
      (treating of Poisons) with a slip of paper left between the leaves; the
      poison described at the place so marked being Digitalis, and the paper
      used being one of his own prescription-papers. &ldquo;If, as I fear, a legal
      investigation into Helena&rsquo;s conduct is a possible event,&rdquo; the doctor
      concluded, &ldquo;there is the evidence that I shall be obliged to give, when I
      am called as a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is my belief that I could have felt no greater dismay, if the long arm
      of the Law had laid its hold on me while he was speaking. I asked what was
      to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she leaves the house at once,&rdquo; the doctor replied, &ldquo;she may escape the
      infamy of being charged with an attempt at murder by poison; and, in her
      absence, I can answer for Philip&rsquo;s life. I don&rsquo;t urge you to warn her,
      because that might be a dangerous thing to do. It is for you to decide, as
      a member of the family, whether you will run the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to speak to him of Euneece, and to tell him what I had already
      related to yourself. He was in no humor to listen to me. &ldquo;Keep it for a
      fitter time,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and think of what I have just said to you.&rdquo;
       With that, he left me, on his way to Philip&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental exertion was completely beyond me. Can you understand a poor
      middle-aged spinster being frightened into doing a dangerous thing? That
      may seem to be nonsense. But if you ask why I took a morsel of paper, and
      wrote the warning which I was afraid to communicate by word of mouth&mdash;why
      I went upstairs with my knees knocking together, and opened the door of
      Helena&rsquo;s room just wide enough to let my hand pass through&mdash;why I
      threw the paper in, and banged the door to again, and ran downstairs as I
      have never run since I was a little girl&mdash;I can only say, in the way
      of explanation, what I have said already: I was frightened into doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I have written, thus far, I shall send to you by to-night&rsquo;s post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came back to me, after he had seen Philip, and spoken with
      Euneece. He was very angry; and, I must own, not without reason. Philip
      had flatly refused to let himself be removed to the hospital; and Euneece&mdash;&ldquo;a
      mere girl&rdquo;&mdash;had declared that she would be answerable for
      consequences! The doctor warned me that he meant to withdraw from the
      case, and to make his declaration before the magistrates. At my entreaties
      he consented to return in the evening, and to judge by results before
      taking the terrible step that he had threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I remained at home on the watch, keeping the doors of both rooms
      locked, Eunice went out to get Philip&rsquo;s medicine. She came back, followed
      by a boy carrying a portable apparatus for cooking. &ldquo;All that Philip
      wants, and all that we want,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;we can provide for
      ourselves. Give me a morsel of paper to write on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unhooking the little pencil attached to her watch-chain, she paused and
      looked toward the door. &ldquo;Somebody listening,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Let them
      listen.&rdquo; She wrote a list of necessaries, in the way of things to eat and
      things to drink, and asked me to go out and get them myself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      doubt the servants,&rdquo; she said, speaking distinctly enough to be heard
      outside; &ldquo;but I am afraid of what a Poisoner&rsquo;s cunning and a Poisoner&rsquo;s
      desperation may do, in a kitchen which is open to her.&rdquo; I went away on my
      errand&mdash;discovering no listener outside, I need hardly say. On my
      return, I found the door of communication with Philip&rsquo;s room closed, but
      no longer locked. &ldquo;We can now attend on him in turn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;without
      opening either of the doors which lead into the hall. At night we can
      relieve each other, and each of us can get sleep as we want it in the
      large armchair in the dining-room. Philip must be safe under our charge,
      or the doctor will insist on taking him to the hospital. When we want
      Maria&rsquo;s help, from time to time, we can employ her under our own
      superintendence. Have you anything else, Selina, to suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing left to suggest. Young and inexperienced as she was, how
      (I asked) had she contrived to think of all this? She answered, simply
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know; my thoughts came to me while I was looking at
      Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterward I found an opportunity of inquiring if Helena had left the
      house. She had just rung her bell; and Maria had found her, quietly
      reading, in her room. Hours afterward, when I was on the watch at night, I
      heard Philip&rsquo;s door softly tried from the outside. Her dreadful purpose
      had not been given up, even yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came in the evening, as he had promised, and found an
      improvement in Philip&rsquo;s health. I mentioned what precautions we had taken,
      and that they had been devised by Euneece. &ldquo;Are you going to withdraw from
      the case?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I am coming back to the case,&rdquo; he answered,
      &ldquo;to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been a disappointment to me to receive no answer to the telegram
      which I had sent to Mr. Dunboyne the elder. The next day&rsquo;s post brought
      the explanation in a letter to Philip from his father, directed to him at
      the hotel here. This showed that my telegram, giving my address at this
      house, had not been received. Mr. Dunboyne announced that he had returned
      to Ireland, finding the air of London unendurable, after the sea-breezes
      at home. If Philip had already married, his father would leave him to a
      life of genteel poverty with Helena Gracedieu. If he had thought better of
      it, his welcome was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did Mr. Dunboyne know what changes had taken place since he and his
      son had last met, and what hope might yet present itself of brighter days
      for poor Euneece! I thought of writing to him. But how would that crabbed
      old man receive a confidential letter from a lady who was a stranger?
    </p>
    <p>
      My doubts were set at rest by Philip himself. He asked me to write a few
      lines of reply to his father; declaring that his marriage with Helena was
      broken off&mdash;that he had not given up all hope of being permitted to
      offer the sincere expression of his penitence to Euneece&mdash;and that he
      would gladly claim his welcome, as soon as he was well enough to undertake
      the journey to Ireland. When he had signed the letter, I was so pleased
      that I made a smart remark. I said: &ldquo;This is a treaty of peace between
      father and son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor arrived in the morning, and found the change for the
      better in his patient confirmed, he did justice to us at last. He spoke
      kindly, and even gratefully, to Euneece. No more allusions to the hospital
      as a place of safety escaped him. He asked me cautiously for news of
      Helena. I could only tell him that she had gone out at her customary time,
      and had returned at her customary time. He did not attempt to conceal that
      my reply had made him uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still afraid that she may succeed in poisoning Philip?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of her cunning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If she is charged with attempting
      to poison young Dunboyne, she has some system of defense, you may rely on
      it, for which we are not prepared. There, in my opinion, is the true
      reason for her extraordinary insensibility to her own danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two more days passed, and we were still safe under the protection of lock
      and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the second day (which was a Monday) Maria came to me in
      great tribulation. On inquiring what was the matter, I received a
      disquieting reply: &ldquo;Miss Helena is tempting me. She is so miserable at
      being prevented from seeing Mr. Philip, and helping to nurse him, that it
      is quite distressing to see her. At the same time, miss, it&rsquo;s hard on a
      poor servant. She asks me to take the key secretly out of the door, and
      lend it to her at night for a few minutes only. I&rsquo;m really afraid I shall
      be led into doing it, if she goes on persuading me much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I commended Maria for feeling scruples which proved her to be the best of
      good girls, and promised to relieve her from all fear of future
      temptation. This was easily done. Euneece kept the key of Philip&rsquo;s door in
      her pocket; and I kept the key of the dining-room door in mine.

      CHAPTER LXI. ATROCITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the next day, a Tuesday in the week, an event took place which Euneece
      and I viewed with distrust. Early in the afternoon, a young man called
      with a note for Helena. It was to be given to her immediately, and no
      answer was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria had just closed the house door, and was on her way upstairs with the
      letter, when she was called back by another ring at the bell. Our visitor
      was the doctor. He spoke to Maria in the hall:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see a note in your hand. Was it given to you by the young man
      who has just left the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s your sweetheart, my dear, I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, doctor, how you do talk! I never saw the young man before
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, Maria, I will ask you to let me look at the address. Aha!
      Mischief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment I heard that I threw open the dining-room door. Curiosity is
      not easily satisfied. When it hears, it wants to see; when it sees, it
      wants to know. Every lady will agree with me in this observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray come in,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, Miss Jillgall. My girl, when you give Miss Helena that note,
      try to get a sly look at her when she opens it, and come and tell me what
      you have seen.&rdquo; He joined me in the dining-room, and closed the door. &ldquo;The
      other day,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;when I told you what I had discovered in the
      chemist&rsquo;s shop, I think I mentioned a young man who was called to speak to
      a question of identity&mdash;an assistant who knew Miss Helena Gracedieu
      by sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man left the note which Maria has just taken upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wrote it, doctor, and what does it say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Questions naturally asked, Miss Jillgall&mdash;and not easily answered.
      Where is Eunice? Her quick wit might help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had gone out to buy some fruit and flowers for Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor accepted his disappointment resignedly. &ldquo;Let us try what we can
      do without her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That young man&rsquo;s master has been in
      consultation (you may remember why) with his lawyer, and Helena may be
      threatened by an investigation before the magistrates. If this wild guess
      of mine turns out to have hit the mark, the poisoner upstairs has got a
      warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked if the chemist had written the note. Foolish enough of me when I
      came to think of it. The chemist would scarcely act a friendly part toward
      Helena, when she was answerable for the awkward position in which he had
      placed himself. Perhaps the young man who had left the warning was also
      the writer of the warning. The doctor reminded me that he was all but a
      stranger to Helena. &ldquo;We are not usually interested,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;in a
      person whom we only know by sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that he is a young man,&rdquo; I ventured to say. This was a strong
      hint, but the doctor failed to see it. He had evidently forgotten his own
      youth. I made another attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And vile as Helena is,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;we cannot deny that this disgrace
      to her sex is a handsome young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw it at last. &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s wit!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have hit it, Miss
      Jillgall. The young fool is smitten with her, and has given her a chance
      of making her escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she will take the chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all our sakes, I pray God she may! But I don&rsquo;t feel sure about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recollect what you and Eunice have done. You have shown your suspicion of
      her without an attempt to conceal it. If you had put her in prison you
      could not have more completely defeated her infernal design. Do you think
      she is a likely person to submit to that, without an effort to be even
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as he said those terrifying words, Maria came back to us. He asked at
      once what had kept her so long upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had evidently something to say, which had inflated her (if I may
      use such an expression) with a sense of her own importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to let me tell it, sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;in my own way. Miss Helena
      turned as pale as ashes when she opened the letter, and then she took a
      turn in the room, and then she looked at me with a smile&mdash;well, miss,
      I can only say that I felt that smile in the small of my back. I tried to
      get to the door. She stopped me. She says: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Eunice?&rsquo; I says:
      &lsquo;Gone out.&rsquo; She says: &lsquo;Is there anybody in the drawing-room?&rsquo; I says: &lsquo;No,
      miss.&rsquo; She says: &lsquo;Tell Miss Jillgall I want to speak to her, and say I am
      waiting in the drawing-room.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s every word of it true! And, if a poor
      servant may give an opinion, I don&rsquo;t like the look of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor dismissed Maria. &ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;you must go
      and hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am not a courageous woman; I expressed myself as being willing to go to
      her, if the doctor went with me. He said that was impossible; she would
      probably refuse to speak before any witness; and certainly before him. But
      he promised to look after Philip in my absence, and to wait below if it
      really so happened that I wanted him. I need only ring the bell, and he
      would come to me the moment he heard it. Such kindness as this roused my
      courage, I suppose. At any rate, I went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by the fire-place, with her elbow on the chimney-piece,
      and her head, resting on her hand. I stopped just inside the door, waiting
      to hear what she had to say. In this position her side-face only was
      presented to me. It was a ghastly face. The eye that I could see turned
      wickedly on me when I came in&mdash;then turned away again. Otherwise, she
      never moved. I confess I trembled, but I did my best to disguise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke out suddenly with what she had to say: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow this state
      of things to go on any longer. My horror of an exposure which will
      disgrace the family has kept me silent, wrongly silent, so far. Philip&rsquo;s
      life is in danger. I am forgetting my duty to my affianced husband, if I
      allow myself to be kept away from him any longer. Open those locked doors,
      and relieve me from the sight of you. Open the doors, I say, or you will
      both of you&mdash;you the accomplice, she the wretch who directs you&mdash;repent
      it to the end of your lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my own mind, I asked myself if she had gone mad. But I only answered:
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said again: &ldquo;You are Eunice&rsquo;s accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accomplice in what?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head slowly and faced me. I shrank from looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the circumstances prove it,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I have supplanted Eunice
      in Philip&rsquo;s affection. She was once engaged to marry him; I am engaged to
      marry him now. She is resolved that he shall never make me his wife. He
      will die if I delay any longer. He will die if I don&rsquo;t crush her, like the
      reptile she is. She comes here&mdash;and what does she do? Keeps him
      prisoner under her own superintendence. Who gets his medicine? She gets
      it. Who cooks his food? She cooks it. The doors are locked. I might be a
      witness of what goes on; and I am kept out. The servants who ought to wait
      on him are kept out. She can do what she likes with his medicine; she can
      do what she likes with his food: she is infuriated with him for deserting
      her, and promising to marry me. Give him back to my care; or, dreadful as
      it is to denounce my own sister, I shall claim protection from the
      magistrates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lost all fear of her: I stepped close up to the place at which she was
      standing; I cried out: &ldquo;Of what, in God&rsquo;s name, do you accuse your
      sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;I accuse her of poisoning Philip Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran out of the room; I rushed headlong down the stairs. The doctor heard
      me, and came running into the hall. I caught hold of him like a madwoman.
      &ldquo;Euneece!&rdquo; My breath was gone; I could only say: &ldquo;Euneece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dragged me into the dining-room. There was wine on the side-board,
      which he had ordered medically for Philip. He forced me to drink some of
      it. It ran through me like fire; it helped me to speak. &ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;what has she done to Eunice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She brings a horrible accusation against her,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the accusation?&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked me through and through. &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No hysterics, no
      exaggeration. You may lead to dreadful consequences if you are not sure of
      yourself. If it&rsquo;s really true, say it again.&rdquo; I said it again&mdash;quietly
      this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face startled me; it was white with rage. He snatched his hat off the
      hall table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty.&rdquo; He was out of the house before I could speak to him again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXII. THE SENTENCE PRONOUNCED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MARTYRS to gout know, by sad experience, that they suffer under one of the
      most capricious of maladies. An attack of this disease will shift, in the
      most unaccountable manner, from one part of the body to another; or, it
      will release the victim when there is every reason to fear that it is
      about to strengthen its hold on him; or, having shown the fairest promise
      of submitting to medical treatment, it will cruelly lay the patient
      prostrate again in a state of relapse. Adverse fortune, in my case,
      subjected me to this last and worst trial of endurance. Two months passed&mdash;months
      of pain aggravated by anxiety&mdash;before I was able to help Eunice and
      Miss Jillgall personally with my sympathy and advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this interval, I heard regularly from the friendly and faithful
      Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terror and suspense, courageously endured day after day, seem to have
      broken down her resistance, poor soul, when Eunice&rsquo;s good name and
      Eunice&rsquo;s tranquillity were threatened by the most infamous of false
      accusations. From that time, Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s method of expressing herself
      betrayed a gradual deterioration. I shall avoid presenting at a
      disadvantage a correspondent who has claims on my gratitude, if I give the
      substance only of what she wrote&mdash;assisted by the newspaper which she
      sent to me, while the legal proceedings were in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest indignation does sometimes counsel us wisely. When the doctor left
      Miss Jillgall, in anger and in haste, he had determined on taking the
      course from which, as a humane man and a faithful friend, he had hitherto
      recoiled. It was no time, now, to shrink from the prospect of an exposure.
      The one hope of successfully encountering the vindictive wickedness of
      Helena lay in the resolution to be beforehand with her, in the appeal to
      the magistrates with which she had threatened Eunice and Miss Jillgall.
      The doctor&rsquo;s sworn information stated the whole terrible case of the
      poisoning, ranging from his first suspicions and their confirmation, to
      Helena&rsquo;s atrocious attempt to accuse her innocent sister of her own guilt.
      So firmly were the magistrates convinced of the serious nature of the case
      thus stated, that they did not hesitate to issue their warrant. Among the
      witnesses whose attendance was immediately secured, by the legal adviser
      to whom the doctor applied, were the farmer and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena was arrested while she was dressing to go out. Her composure was
      not for a moment disturbed. &ldquo;I was on my way,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;to make a
      statement before the justices. The sooner they hear what I have to say the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attempt of this shameless wretch to &ldquo;turn the tables&rdquo; on poor Eunice&mdash;suggested,
      as I afterward discovered, by the record of family history which she had
      quoted in her journal&mdash;was defeated with ease. The farmer and his
      wife proved the date at which Eunice had left her place of residence under
      their roof. The doctor&rsquo;s evidence followed. He proved, by the production
      of his professional diary, that the discovery of the attempt to poison his
      patient had taken place before the day of Eunice&rsquo;s departure from the
      farm, and that the first improvement in Mr. Philip Dunboyne&rsquo;s state of
      health had shown itself after that young lady&rsquo;s arrival to perform the
      duties of a nurse. To the wise precautions which she had taken&mdash;perverted
      by Helena to the purpose of a false accusation&mdash;the doctor attributed
      the preservation of the young man&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having produced the worst possible impression on the minds of the
      magistrates, Helena was remanded. Her legal adviser had predicted this
      result; but the vindictive obstinacy of his client had set both experience
      and remonstrance at defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the renewed examination, the line of defense adopted by the prisoner&rsquo;s
      lawyer proved to be&mdash;mistaken identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was asserted that she had never entered the chemist&rsquo;s shop; also, that
      the assistant had wrongly identified some other lady as Miss Helena
      Gracedieu; also, that there was not an atom of evidence to connect her
      with the stealing of the doctor&rsquo;s prescription-paper and the forgery of
      his writing. Other assertions to the same purpose followed, on which it is
      needless to dwell. The case for the prosecution was, happily, in competent
      hands. With the exception of one witness, cross-examination afforded no
      material help to the evidence for the defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chemist swore positively to the personal appearance of Helena, as
      being the personal appearance of the lady who had presented the
      prescription. His assistant, pressed on the question of identity, broke
      down under cross-examination&mdash;purposely, as it was whispered, serving
      the interests of the prisoner. But the victory, so far gained by the
      defense, was successfully contested by the statement of the next witness,
      a respectable tradesman in the town. He had seen the newspaper report of
      the first examination, and had volunteered to present himself as a
      witness. A member of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s congregation, his pew in the chapel
      was so situated as to give him a view of the minister&rsquo;s daughters
      occupying their pew. He had seen the prisoner on every Sunday, for years
      past; and he swore that he was passing the door of the chemist&rsquo;s shop, at
      the moment when she stepped out into the street, having a bottle covered
      with the customary white paper in her hand. The doctor and his servant
      were the next witnesses called. They were severely cross-examined. Some of
      their statements&mdash;questioned technically with success&mdash;received
      unexpected and powerful support, due to the discovery and production of
      the prisoner&rsquo;s diary. The entries, guardedly as some of them were written,
      revealed her motive for attempting to poison Philip Dunboyne; proved that
      she had purposely called on the doctor when she knew that he would be out,
      that she had entered the consulting-room, and examined the medical books,
      had found (to use her own written words) &ldquo;a volume that interested her,&rdquo;
       and had used the prescription-papers for the purpose of making notes. The
      notes themselves were not to be found; they had doubtless been destroyed.
      Enough, and more than enough, remained to make the case for the
      prosecution complete. The magistrates committed Helena Gracedieu for trial
      at the next assizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived in the town, as well as I can remember, about a week after the
      trial had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Found guilty, the prisoner had been recommended to mercy by the jury&mdash;partly
      in consideration of her youth; partly as an expression of sympathy and
      respect for her unhappy father. The judge (a father himself) passed a
      lenient sentence. She was condemned to imprisonment for two years. The
      careful matron of the jail had provided herself with a bottle of
      smelling-salts, in the fear that there might be need for it when Helena
      heard her sentence pronounced. Not the slightest sign of agitation
      appeared in her face or her manner. She lied to the last; asserting her
      innocence in a firm voice, and returning from the dock to the prison
      without requiring assistance from anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relating these particulars to me, in a state of ungovernable excitement,
      good Miss Jillgall ended with a little confession of her own, which
      operated as a relief to my overburdened mind after what I had just heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t own it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to anybody but a dear friend. One thing,
      in the dreadful disgrace that has fallen on us, I am quite at a loss to
      account for. Think of Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s daughter being one of those criminal
      creatures on whom it was once your terrible duty to turn the key! Why
      didn&rsquo;t she commit suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady, no thoroughly wicked creature ever yet committed suicide.
      Self-destruction, when it is not an act of madness, implies some acuteness
      of feeling&mdash;sensibility to remorse or to shame, or perhaps a
      distorted idea of making atonement. There is no such thing as remorse or
      shame, or hope of making atonement, in Helena&rsquo;s nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when she comes out of prison, what will she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, my good friend. She will do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush! hush! Poetical justice, Mr. Governor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poetical fiddlesticks, Miss Jillgall.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LXIII. THE OBSTACLE REMOVED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the subject of the trial was happily dismissed, my first inquiry
      related to Eunice. The reply was made with an ominous accompaniment of
      sighs and sad looks. Eunice had gone back to her duties as governess at
      the farm. Hearing this, I asked naturally what had become of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melancholy news, again, was the news that I now heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunboyne the elder had died suddenly, at his house in Ireland, while
      Philip was on his way home. When the funeral ceremony had come to an end,
      the will was read. It had been made only a few days before the testator&rsquo;s
      death; and the clause which left all his property to his son was preceded
      by expressions of paternal affection, at a time when Philip was in sore
      need of consolation. After alluding to a letter, received from his son,
      the old man added: &ldquo;I always loved him, without caring to confess it; I
      detest scenes of sentiment, kissings, embracings, tears, and that sort of
      thing. But Philip has yielded to my wishes, and has broken off a marriage
      which would have made him, as well as me, wretched for life. After this, I
      may speak my mind from my grave, and may tell my boy that I loved him. If
      the wish is likely to be of any use, I will add (on the chance)&mdash;God
      bless him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Philip submit to separation from Eunice?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Does he stay in
      Ireland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he, poor fellow! He will be here to-morrow or next day. When I last
      wrote,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall continued, &ldquo;I told him I hoped to see you again
      soon. If you can&rsquo;t help us (I mean with Eunice) that unlucky young man
      will do some desperate thing. He will join those madmen at large who
      disturb poor savages in Africa, or go nowhere to find nothing in the
      Arctic regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever I can do, Miss Jillgall, shall be gladly done. Is it really
      possible that Eunice refuses to marry him, after having saved his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little patience, please, Mr. Governor; let Philip tell his own story.
      If I try to do it, I shall only cry&mdash;and we have had tears enough
      lately, in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further consultation being thus deferred, I went upstairs to the
      Minister&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting by the window, in his favorite armchair, absorbed in
      knitting! The person who attended on him, a good-natured, patient fellow,
      had been a sailor in his younger days, and had taught Mr. Gracedieu how to
      use the needles. &ldquo;You see it amuses him,&rdquo; the man said, kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      notice his mistakes, he thinks there isn&rsquo;t such another in the world for
      knitting as himself. You can see, sir, how he sticks to it.&rdquo; He was so
      absorbed over his employment that I had to speak to him twice, before I
      could induce him to look at me. The utter ruin of his intellect did not
      appear to have exercised any disastrous influence over his bodily health.
      On the contrary, he had grown fatter since I had last seen him; his
      complexion had lost the pallor that I remembered&mdash;there was color in
      his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember your old friend?&rdquo; I said. He smiled, and nodded, and
      repeated the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my old friend.&rdquo; It was only too plain that he had not the least
      recollection of me. &ldquo;His memory is gone,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;When he puts away
      his knitting, at night, I have to find it for him in the morning. But,
      there! he&rsquo;s happy&mdash;enjoys his victuals, likes sitting out in the
      garden and watching the birds. There&rsquo;s been a deal of trouble in the
      family, sir; and it has all passed over him like a wet sponge over a
      slate.&rdquo; The old sailor was right. If that wreck of a man had been capable
      of feeling and thinking, his daughter&rsquo;s disgrace would have broken his
      heart. In a world of sin and sorrow, is peaceable imbecility always to be
      pitied? I have known men who would have answered, without hesitation: &ldquo;It
      is to be envied.&rdquo; And where (some persons might say) was the poor
      Minister&rsquo;s reward for the act of mercy which had saved Eunice in her
      infancy? Where it ought to be! A man who worthily performs a good action
      finds his reward in the action itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast, on the next day, the talk touched on those passages in
      Helena&rsquo;s diary, which had been produced in court as evidence against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expressed a wish to see what revelation of a depraved nature the entries
      in the diary might present; and my curiosity was gratified. At a fitter
      time, I may find an opportunity of alluding to the impression produced on
      me by the diary. In the meanwhile, the event of Philip&rsquo;s return claims
      notice in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow was so glad to see me that he shook hands as heartily as
      if we had known each other from the time when he was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember how kindly you spoke to me when I called on you in
      London?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If I have repeated those words once&mdash;but perhaps
      you don&rsquo;t remember them? You said: &lsquo;If I was as young as you are, I should
      not despair.&rsquo; Well! I have said that to myself over and over again, for a
      hundred times at least. Eunice will listen to you, sir, when she will
      listen to nobody else. This is the first happy moment I have had for weeks
      past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I must have looked glad to hear that. Anyway, Philip shook hands
      with me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall was present. The gentle-hearted old maid was so touched by
      our meeting that she abandoned herself to the genial impulse of the
      moment, and gave Philip a kiss. The outraged claims of propriety instantly
      seized on her. She blushed as if the long-lost days of her girlhood had
      been found again, and ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Philip,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have been waiting, at Miss Jillgall&rsquo;s
      suggestion, to get my information from you. There is something wrong
      between Eunice and yourself. What is it? And who is to blame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her vile sister is to blame,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That reptile was determined
      to sting us. And she has done it!&rdquo; he cried, starting to his feet, and
      walking up and down the room, urged into action by his own unendurable
      sense of wrong. &ldquo;I say, she has done it, after Eunice has saved me&mdash;done
      it, when Eunice was ready to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has she done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between grief and indignation his reply was involved in a confusion of
      vehemently-spoken words, which I shall not attempt to reproduce. Eunice
      had reminded him that her sister had been publicly convicted of an
      infamous crime, and publicly punished for it by imprisonment. &ldquo;If I
      consent to marry you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I stain you with my disgrace; that shall
      never be.&rdquo; With this resolution, she had left him. &ldquo;I have tried to
      convince her,&rdquo; Philip said, &ldquo;that she will not be associated with her
      sister&rsquo;s disgrace when she bears my name; I have promised to take her far
      away from England, among people who have never even heard of her sister.
      Miss Jillgall has used her influence to help me. All in vain! There is no
      hope for us but in you. I am not thinking selfishly only of myself. She
      tries to conceal it&mdash;but, oh, she is broken-hearted! Ask the farmer&rsquo;s
      wife, if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Judge for yourself, sir. Go&mdash;for God&rsquo;s
      sake, go to the farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made him sit down and compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend on my going to the farm,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I shall write to
      Eunice to-day, and follow my letter to-morrow.&rdquo; He tried to thank me; but
      I would not allow it. &ldquo;Before I consent to accept the expression of your
      gratitude,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I must know a little more of you than I know now.
      This is only the second occasion on which we have met. Let us look back a
      little, Mr. Philip Dunboyne. You were Eunice&rsquo;s affianced husband; and you
      broke faith with her. That was a rascally action. How do you defend it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head sank. &ldquo;I am ashamed to defend it,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed him without mercy. &ldquo;You own yourself,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it was a
      rascally action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use stronger language against me, even than that, sir&mdash;I deserve
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain words,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;you can find no excuse for your conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the past time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might have found excuses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t find them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not even look for them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe it to Eunice to leave my conduct at its worst; with nothing said&mdash;by
      me&mdash;to defend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Eunice done to have such a claim on you as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eunice has forgiven me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was gratefully and delicately said. Ought I to have allowed this
      circumstance to weigh with me? I ask, in return, had <i>I</i> never
      committed any faults? As a fellow-mortal and fellow-sinner, had I any
      right to harden my heart against an expression of penitence which I felt
      to be sincere in its motive?
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was bound to think of Eunice. I did think of her, before I ventured
      to accept the position&mdash;the critical position, as I shall presently
      show&mdash;of Philip&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After more than an hour of questions put without reserve, and of answers
      given without prevarication, I had traveled over the whole ground laid out
      by the narratives which appear in these pages, and had arrived at my
      conclusion&mdash;so far as Philip Dunboyne was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him to be a man with nothing absolutely wicked in him&mdash;but
      with a nature so perilously weak, in many respects, that it might drift
      into wickedness unless a stronger nature was at hand to bold it back.
      Married to a wife without force of character, the probabilities would
      point to him as likely to yield to examples which might make him a bad
      husband. Married to a wife with a will of her own, and with true love to
      sustain her&mdash;a wife who would know when to take the command and how
      to take the command&mdash;a wife who, finding him tempted to commit
      actions unworthy of his better self, would be far-sighted enough to
      perceive that her husband&rsquo;s sense of honor might sometimes lose its
      balance, without being on that account hopelessly depraved&mdash;then,
      and, in these cases only, the probabilities would point to Philip as a man
      likely to be the better and the happier for his situation, when the bonds
      of wedlock had got him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the serious question was not answered yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I feel justified in placing Eunice in the position toward Philip
      which I have just endeavored to describe? I dared not allow my mind to
      dwell on the generosity which had so nobly pardoned him, or on the force
      of character which had bravely endured the bitterest disappointment, the
      cruelest humiliation. The one consideration which I was bound to face, was
      the sacred consideration of her happiness in her life to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Philip, with a few words of sympathy which might help him to bear
      his suspense, I went to my room to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time passed&mdash;and I could arrive at no positive conclusion. Either
      way&mdash;with or without Philip&mdash;the contemplation of Eunice&rsquo;s
      future harassed me with doubt. Even if I had conquered my own indecision,
      and had made up my mind to sanction the union of the two young people, the
      difficulties that now beset me would not have been dispersed. Knowing what
      I alone knew, I could certainly remove Eunice&rsquo;s one objection to the
      marriage. In other words, I had only to relate what had happened on the
      day when the Chaplain brought the Minister to the prison, and the obstacle
      of their union would be removed. But, without considering Philip, it was
      simply out of the question to do this, in mercy to Eunice herself. What
      was Helena&rsquo;s disgrace, compared with the infamy which stained the name of
      the poor girl&rsquo;s mother! The other alternative of telling her part of the
      truth only was before me, if I could persuade myself to adopt it. I failed
      to persuade myself; my morbid anxiety for her welfare made me hesitate
      again. Human patience could endure no more. Rashness prevailed and
      prudence yielded&mdash;I left my decision to be influenced by the coming
      interview with Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I drove to the farm. Philip&rsquo;s entreaties persuaded me to let
      him be my companion, on one condition&mdash;that he waited in the carriage
      while I went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had carefully arranged my ideas, and had decided on proceeding with the
      greatest caution, before I ventured on saying the all-important words
      which, once spoken, were not to be recalled. The worst of those anxieties,
      under which the delicate health of Mr. Gracedieu had broken down, was my
      anxiety now. Could I reconcile it to my conscience to permit a man,
      innocent of all knowledge of the truth, to marry the daughter of a
      condemned murderess, without honestly telling him what he was about to do?
      Did I deserve to be pitied? did I deserve to be blamed?&mdash;my mind was
      still undecided when I entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to meet me as if she had been my daughter; she kissed me as if she
      had been my daughter; she fondly looked up at me as if she had been my
      daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so
      patiently enduring sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything
      artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had thanked me for coming to see her, I saw her tremble a
      little. The uppermost interest in her heart was forcing its way outward to
      expression, try as she might to keep it back. &ldquo;Have you seen Philip?&rdquo; she
      asked. The tone in which she put that question decided me&mdash;I was
      resolved to let her marry him. Impulse! Yes, impulse, asserting itself
      inexcusably in a man at the end of his life. I ought to have known better
      than to have given way. Very likely. But am I the only mortal who ought to
      have known better&mdash;and did not?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Eunice asked if I had seen Philip, I owned that he was outside in the
      carriage. Before she could reproach me, I went on with what I had to say:
      &ldquo;My child, I know what a sacrifice you have made; and I should honor your
      scruples, if you had any reason for feeling them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any reason for feeling them?&rdquo; She turned pale as she repeated the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea came to me. I rang for the servant, and sent her to the carriage
      to tell Philip to come in. &ldquo;My dear, I am not putting you to any unfair
      trial,&rdquo; I assured her; &ldquo;I am going to prove that I love you as truly as if
      you were my own child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were both present, I resolved that they should not suffer a
      moment of needless suspense. Standing between them, I took Eunice&rsquo;s hand,
      and laid my other hand on Philip&rsquo;s shoulder, and spoke out plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here to make you both happy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can remove the only
      obstacle to your marriage, and I mean to do it. But I must insist on one
      condition. Give me your promise, Philip, that you will ask for no
      explanations, and that you will be satisfied with the one true statement
      which is all that I can offer to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his promise, without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip grants what I ask,&rdquo; I said to Eunice. &ldquo;Do you grant it, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand turned cold in mine; but she spoke firmly when she said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her into Philip&rsquo;s care. It was his privilege to console and support
      her. It was my duty to say the decisive words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse your courage, dear Eunice; you are no more affected by Helena&rsquo;s
      disgrace than I am. You are not her sister. Her father is not your father;
      her mother was not your mother. I was present, in the time of your
      infancy, when Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s fatherly kindness received you as his
      adopted child. This, I declare to you both, on my word of honor, is the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How she bore it I am not able to say. My foolish old eyes were filling
      with tears. I could just see plainly enough to find my way to the door,
      and leave them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my reckless state of mind, I never asked myself if Time would be my
      accomplice, and keep the part of the secret which I had not revealed&mdash;or
      be my enemy, and betray me. The chances, either way, were perhaps equal.
      The deed was done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIV. THE TRUTH TRIUMPHANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The marriage was deferred, at Eunice&rsquo;s request, as an expression of
      respect to the memory of Philip&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time of delay had passed, it was arranged that the wedding
      ceremony should be held&mdash;after due publication of Banns&mdash;at the
      parish church of the London suburb in which my house was situated. Miss
      Jillgall was bridesmaid, and I gave away the bride. Before we set out for
      the church, Eunice asked leave to speak with me for a moment in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I am forgetting my promise to be content
      with what you have told me about myself. I am not so ungrateful as that.
      But I do want, before I consent to be Philip&rsquo;s wife, to feel sure that I
      am not quite unworthy of him. Is it because I am of mean birth that you
      told me I was Mr. Gracedieu&rsquo;s adopted child&mdash;and told me no more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could honestly satisfy her, so far. &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms round my neck. &ldquo;Do you say that,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to make my
      mind easy? or do you say it on your word of honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word of honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at the church. Let Miss Jillgall describe the marriage, in her
      own inimitable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wedding breakfast, when you don&rsquo;t want to eat it. No wedding speeches,
      when nobody wants to make them, and nobody wants to hear them. And no
      false sentiment, shedding tears and reddening noses, on the happiest day
      in the whole year. A model marriage! I could desire nothing better, if I
      had any prospect of being a bride myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away for their honeymoon to a quiet place by the seaside, not
      very far from the town in which Eunice had passed some of the happiest and
      the wretchedest days in her life. She persisted in thinking it possible
      that Mr. Gracedieu might recover the use of his faculties, at the last,
      and might wish to see her on his death-bed. &ldquo;His adopted daughter,&rdquo; she
      gently reminded me, &ldquo;is his only daughter now.&rdquo; The doctor shook his head
      when I told him what Eunice had said to me&mdash;and, the sad truth must
      be told, the doctor was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jillgall returned, on the wedding-day, to take care of the good man
      who had befriended her in her hour of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the week, I heard from her, and was disagreeably
      reminded of an incident which we had both forgotten, absorbed as we were
      in other and greater interests, at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tenbruggen had again appeared on the scene! She had written to Miss
      Jillgall, from Paris, to say that she had heard of old Mr. Dunboyne&rsquo;s
      death, and that she wished to have the letter returned, which she had left
      for delivery to Philip&rsquo;s father on the day when Philip and Eunice were
      married. I had my own suspicions of what that letter might contain; and I
      regretted that Miss Jillgall had sent it back without first waiting to
      consult me. My misgivings, thus excited, were increased by more news of no
      very welcome kind. Mrs. Tenbruggen had decided on returning to her
      professional pursuits in England. Massage, now the fashion everywhere, had
      put money into her pocket among the foreigners; and her husband, finding
      that she persisted in keeping out of his reach, had consented to a
      compromise. He was ready to submit to a judicial separation; in
      consideration of a little income which his wife had consented to settle on
      him, under the advice of her lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days later, I received a delightful letter from Philip and Eunice;
      reminding me that I had engaged to pay them a visit at the seaside. My
      room was ready for me, and I was left to choose my own day. I had just
      begun to write my reply, gladly accepting the invitation, when an ominous
      circumstance occurred. My servant announced &ldquo;a lady&rdquo;; and I found myself
      face to face with&mdash;Mrs. Tenbruggen!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as cheerful as ever, and as eminently agreeable as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it all from Selina,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Philip&rsquo;s marriage to Eunice
      (I shall go and congratulate them, of course), and the catastrophe (how
      dramatic!) of Helena Gracedieu. I warned. Selina that Miss Helena would
      end badly. To tell the truth, she frightened me. I don&rsquo;t deny that I am a
      mischievous woman when I find myself affronted, quite capable of taking my
      revenge in my own small spiteful way. But poison and murder&mdash;ah, the
      frightful subject! let us drop it, and talk of something that doesn&rsquo;t make
      my hair (it&rsquo;s really my own hair) stand on end. Has Selina told you that I
      have got rid of my charming husband, on easy pecuniary terms? Oh, you know
      that? Very well. I will tell you something that you don&rsquo;t know. Mr.
      Governor, I have found you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I venture to ask how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I guessed which was which of those two girls,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and
      guessed wrong, you deliberately encouraged the mistake. Very clever, but
      you overdid it. From that moment, though I kept it to myself, I began to
      fear I might be wrong. Do you remember Low Lanes, my dear sir? A charming
      old church. I have had another consultation with my lawyer. His questions
      led me into mentioning how it happened that I heard of Low Lanes. After
      looking again at his memorandum of the birth advertised in the newspaper
      without naming the place&mdash;he proposed trying the church register at
      Low Lanes. Need I tell you the result? I know, as well as you do, that
      Philip has married the adopted child. He has had a mother-in-law who was
      hanged, and, what is more, he has the honor, through his late father, of
      being otherwise connected with the murderess by marriage&mdash;as his
      aunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bewilderment and dismay deprived me of my presence of mind. &ldquo;How did you
      discover that?&rdquo; I was foolish enough to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember when I brought the baby to the prison?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
      father&mdash;as I mentioned at the time&mdash;had been a dear and valued
      friend of mine. No person could be better qualified to tell me who had
      married his wife&rsquo;s sister. If that lady had been living, I should never
      have been troubled with the charge of the child. Any more questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one. Is Philip to hear of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for shame! I don&rsquo;t deny that Philip insulted me grossly, in one way;
      and that Philip&rsquo;s late father insulted me grossly, in another way. But
      Mamma Tenbruggen is a Christian. She returns good for evil, and wouldn&rsquo;t
      for the world disturb the connubial felicity of Mr. and Mrs. Philip
      Dunboyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the woman was out of my house, I sent a telegram to Philip to
      say that he might expect to see me that night. I caught the last train in
      the evening; and I sat down to supper with those two harmless young
      creatures, knowing I must prepare the husband for what threatened them,
      and weakly deferring it, when I found myself in their presence, until the
      next day. Eunice was, in some degree, answerable for this hesitation on my
      part. No one could look at her husband, and fail to see that he was a
      supremely happy man. But I detected signs of care in the wife&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before breakfast the next morning I was out on the beach, trying to decide
      how the inevitable disclosure might be made. Eunice joined me. Now, when
      we were alone, I asked if she was really and completely happy. Quietly and
      sadly she answered: &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hardly knew what to say. My face must have expressed disappointment and
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be quite happy,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;till I know what it is that
      you kept from me on that memorable day. I don&rsquo;t like having a secret from
      my husband&mdash;though it is not <i>my</i> secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember your promise,&rdquo; I said
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I can only wish that my promise would
      keep back the thoughts that come to me in spite of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thoughts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something, as I fear, in the story of my parents which you are
      afraid to confide to me. Why did Mr. Gracedieu allow me to believe and
      leave everybody to believe, that I was his own child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I relieved your mind of those doubts on the morning of your
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was only thinking of myself at that time. My mother&mdash;the doubt
      of <i>her</i> is the doubt that torments me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arm in mine, and held by it with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mock-mother!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Do you remember that dreadful Vision,
      that horrid whispering temptation in the dead of night? <i>Was</i> it a
      mock-mother? Oh, pity me! I don&rsquo;t know who my mother was. One horrid
      thought about her is a burden on my mind. If she was a good woman, you who
      love me would surely have made me happy by speaking of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words decided me at last. Could she suffer more than she had
      suffered already, if I trusted her with the truth? I ran the risk. There
      was a time of silence that filled me with terror. The interval passed. She
      took my hand, and put it to her heart. &ldquo;Does it beat as if I was
      frightened?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! It was beating calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it relieve your anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It told me that I had not surprised her. That unforgotten Vision of the
      night had prepared her for the worst, after the time when I had told her
      that she was an adopted child. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that those whispered
      temptations overpowered you again, when you and Helena met on the stairs,
      and you forbade her to enter Philip&rsquo;s room. And I know that love had
      conquered once more, when you were next seen sitting by Philip&rsquo;s bedside.
      Tell me&mdash;have you any misgivings now? Is there fear in your heart of
      the return of that tempting spirit in you, in the time to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while Philip lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There, where her love was&mdash;there her safety was. And she knew it! She
      suddenly left me. I asked where she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell Philip,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was waiting for me at the door, when I followed her to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said: &lsquo;My darling, if I could be fonder of you than ever, I should be
      fonder of you now.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have been blamed for being too ready to confide to Philip the precious
      trust of Eunice&rsquo;s happiness. If that reply does not justify me, where is
      justification to be found?

    <h2>
      POSTSCRIPT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Later in the day, Mrs. Tenbruggen arrived to offer her congratulations.
      She asked for a few minutes with Philip alone. As a cat elaborates her
      preparations for killing a mouse, so the human cat elaborated her
      preparations for killing Philip&rsquo;s happiness, he remained uninjured by her
      teeth and her claws. &ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has told you of it already?&rdquo;
       And Philip answered: &ldquo;Yes; my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some months longer, Mr. Gracedieu lingered. One morning, he said to
      Eunice: &ldquo;I want to teach you to knit. Sit by me, and see me do it.&rdquo; His
      hands fell softly on his lap; his head sank little by little on her
      shoulder. She could just hear him whisper: &ldquo;How pleasant it is to sleep!&rdquo;
       Never was Death&rsquo;s dreadful work more gently done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our married pair live now on the paternal estate in Ireland; and Miss
      Jillgall reigns queen of domestic affairs. I am still strong enough to
      pass my autumn holidays in that pleasant house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, my memory reverts to Helena Gracedieu, and to what I discovered
      when I had seen her diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little I knew of that terrible creature when I first met with her, and
      fancied that she had inherited her mother&rsquo;s character! It was weak indeed
      to compare the mean vices of Mrs. Gracedieu with the diabolical depravity
      of her daughter. Here the doctrine of hereditary transmission of moral
      qualities must own that it has overlooked the fertility (for growth of
      good and for growth of evil equally) which is inherent in human nature.
      There are virtues that exalt us, and vices that degrade us, whose
      mysterious origin is, not in our parents, but in ourselves. When I think
      of Helena, I ask myself, where is the trace which reveals that the first
      murder in the world was the product of inherited crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      The criminal left the prison, on the expiration of her sentence, so
      secretly that it was impossible to trace her. Some months later, Miss
      Jillgall received an illustrated newspaper published in the United States.
      She showed me one of the portraits in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize the illustrious original?&rdquo; she asked, with indignant
      emphasis on the last two words. I recognized Helena. &ldquo;Now read her new
      title,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read: &ldquo;The Reverend Miss Gracedieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The biographical notice followed. Here is an extract: &ldquo;This eminent lady,
      the victim of a shocking miscarriage of justice in England, is now the
      distinguished leader of a new community in the United States. We hail in
      her the great intellect which asserts the superiority of woman over man.
      In the first French Revolution, the attempt made by men to found a
      rational religion met with only temporary success. It was reserved for the
      mightier spirit of woman to lay the foundations more firmly, and to
      dedicate one of the noblest edifices in this city to the Worship of Pure
      Reason. Readers who wish for further information will do well to provide
      themselves with the Reverend Miss Gracedieu&rsquo;s Orations&mdash;the tenth
      edition of which is advertised in our columns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once asked you,&rdquo; Miss Jillgall reminded me, &ldquo;what Helena would do when
      she came out of prison, and you said she would do very well. Oh, Mr.
      Governor, Solomon was nothing to You!&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
